bond markets could see mini boom bust cycles global government debt soar 5 trillion year,Business Insider,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/bonds/bond-markets-global-debt-boom-bust-cycle-iif-fixed-income-2023-11,abrupt surge government expenditures global election cycle could increase interest burden many sovereign debtors,wsmahar getty images ul li global bond markets face mini boom bust cycles institute international finance said li li growing deficits made extreme next year e 2243 chars,2023-11-16T20:49:44Z,"       Surging deficits and an unrestrained rise in global debt could unleash new volatility in fixed-income markets, the Institute of International Finance forecast in a Thursday note.  Between 2024 and 2027, government overspending is expected to add $5.3 trillion per year to international debt, at a time when higher-for-longer interest rates are already skewing investor sentiment.  This could trigger 'mini boom-bust cycles' to become a larger theme in fixed income, the institute said. It's the sort of volatility US Treasurys recently underwent, as worries of increased government borrowing helped fuel last month's massive bond sell-off.  Higher deficits aren't limited to the US, and a number of government budgets are becoming constrained by a higher share of interest expenses, such as Egypt, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey. But the trend could also accelerate as over 50 countries are headed into an election season in 2024, the note added. Currently ruling parties may face increased difficulty amid rising private sector debt woes, and worsening geopolitical conditions.  ""If upcoming elections lead to populist policies aimed at controlling social tensions, the result could be still more government borrowing and still less fiscal restraint,"" it said, adding, ""An abrupt surge in government expenditures during this global election cycle could further increase the interest burden for many sovereign debtors—from already high levels.""  In 2023, global government debt jumped to $88.1 trillion, an 8% increase from a year earlier.  Meanwhile, though the global debt-to-GDP ratio — a measure of whether international growth is keeping up with increasing debt — remained relatively stable at 333%, this varied by geography.   The debt ratio in emerging markets hit an all-time high of 255%. The surge was more evident in countries such as Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia, the institute said. ""Looking ahead, we anticipate the global debt ratio to resume its upward trend as global growth momentum remains weak, and inflationary pressures continue to ease,"" it noted.

ellen johnson sirleaf forging new path next generation women leaders,Time,https://time.com/6333021/ellen-johnson-sirleaf-time100-impact-awards/,nobel prize laureate former president liberia fosters women public service leadership amujae initiative,ellen johnson sirleaf wouldnt want women follow footsteps doesnt mean wont encourage run office wishes could less arduous th 4042 chars,2023-11-09T12:59:48Z,"Ellen Johnson Sirleaf wouldn’t want other women to have to follow in her footsteps. That doesn’t mean she won’t encourage them to run for office. It’s just that she wishes it could be less arduous for those who come next. When she ascended to the presidency of Liberia in 2006—becoming Africa's first democratically-elected female head of state—she faced deep-seated misogyny, exile, and prison. “My journey to the presidency was not an easy one,” Sirleaf says. “When I work for the promotion of women to higher positions, I do so in recognition of the fact that I would not want any woman to have the experiences I had because of her ambition.”  Nonetheless, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate is setting Africa’s next generation of female leaders on the path to power, knowing that while the climb is steep, the summit is worth it—not just for the women who lead, but for all those they represent. “Women bring another dimension to leadership,” she says. “They settle conflict rather than fight to resolve it. That does not take away from the application of the strength of authority when required, but when they can find an alternative route to peace, they seek it.” Sirleaf has been a relentless advocate for peace, democracy, and women’s empowerment since she first took public office as Liberia’s Finance Minister in 1979. As president, she deftly steered her country through its tumultuous post-civil war period, mobilizing more than $16 billion in foreign direct investment, lifting trade sanctions, and setting a trajectory for growth, despite the 2014 Ebola outbreak that claimed more than 5,000 lives. Early in her first term, she made education free and compulsory for elementary-age children, acting on her belief that a strong democracy requires an educated populace. She also appointed women to several high-ranking cabinet positions, including the ministries of finance, law, commerce, and development, setting examples for the next generation of Liberia’s female leaders. In 2011, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside fellow Liberian Leymah Gbowee and Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman for their work amplifying women’s role in peacebuilding efforts. Then, after concluding her constitutionally-limited second presidential term in 2018, she stepped down peacefully—the first Liberian president to do so in 75 years. Having recently turned 85, Sirleaf is applying the same degree of ambition, pragmatism and determination that defined her presidency—she came by her nickname, the Iron Lady of Africa, for a reason—to cultivate a new generation of African women leaders. “I don't accept the reports coming out of the U.N. that it will take us 130 years to achieve gender equality [at the highest levels of power],” she says. “The pace of women achieving higher levels is not fast enough. But it has gathered a momentum that is irreversible.” That momentum is possible in part due to her efforts. Sirleaf’s Amujae Initiative, the flagship program of the Ellen John Sirleaf Presidential Center for Women and Development, fosters women’s public service leadership through training, mentorships, coaching and the sharing of experience. Nearly 50 women, drawn from all sectors of African society, have participated in the program since its 2020 launch, strengthening a growing network of capable, committed women in public service who are already positively influencing the perception of female leaders across the continent. “I doubt if women today will go through the extent of the difficulties I faced,” she says, “but they will be prepared—they must be prepared—to accept the fact that the world has not yet accepted the full equality of women.” The only way to overcome it, she says, is to see even more women in power.  For all her accomplishments and accolades, Sirleaf says the most important title she has is that of role model. “Despite the difficulties, I have no regrets. Today, I go into a room and young women come up to me and say, ‘I want to be like you.’” Now, she is ensuring they can be.This profile is published as a part of TIME’s TIME100 Impact Awards initiative, which recognizes leaders from across the world who are driving change in their communities.

Formal donors should be seeking ways to amplify their impact.  LONDON – The African diaspora is the biggest funder of change on the continent. Since remittances are informal, often unreported, and narrowly targeted, they tend to be overlooked. But their scale is large, sustained by diasporic Africans’ powerful commitment to improve the lot of family members and communities they love. Formal givers like me should not only learn from this, but also seek opportunities to collaborate with the diaspora to strengthen its members’ impact.   In 2022, the 160 million Africans who live outside of the continent sent home more than $95 billion in remittances. Of that, about $53 billion went to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and Zimbabwe the top destinations. This compares with $30 billion in foreign direct investment and just $29 billion in official development aid for Sub-Saharan Africa.   Notably, FDI and aid declined last year, as global challenges, such as surging inflation and the Ukraine war, caused donors to reduce or redirect their giving. But remittances increased for many of the same reasons: Africans in the diaspora knew that their families and communities were grappling with food insecurity, as well as natural disasters like floods and severe drought.

cop28 must repeat mistakes africa climate summit,Al Jazeera English,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/11/18/cop28-must-not-repeat-the-mistakes-of-the-africa-climate-summit,lobbyists big emitters global north must allowed push false solutions cop28,late november 2023 united nations climate change conference cop28 launched dubai coming end year broke multiple heat records event supposed set 4887 chars,2023-11-18T13:07:34Z,"Lobbyists for big emitters in the Global North must not be allowed to push false solutions on COP28. In late November, the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) will be launched in Dubai. Coming at the end of a year which broke multiple heat records, the event is supposed to set the stage for a major push to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost climate change adaptation globally. But ahead of the conference, there have already been warnings from climate activists and civil society that unless there is a marked change in the approach to climate policies, COP28 could fail to deliver any meaningful progress. In the Global South, there is persistent worry that wealthy nations and international corporations will push for policies that allow them to continue business as usual, with poorer nations, which are the least responsible for climate change, bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. Such tendencies have already been observed at previous climate events, including most recently at the Africa Climate Summit held in Nairobi in early September. The conference, which gathered thousands of representatives from governments, businesses, international organisations and civil society, was a chance for African peoples to agree on a common position on issues such as loss and damage compensation, climate mitigation and climate finance ahead of COP28. But the final document issued by the summit – the Nairobi Declaration – did not reflect a consensus and the best interest of African nations. This is not surprising, given that lobbyists for Global North countries and corporations were given the space and high-level access to push for false solutions. Meanwhile, many of the delegates – activists and members of civil society calling for clarity and solutions to support our continent ­– faced access difficulties during proceedings and were left feeling sidelined. As a result, instead of pushing for policies that would see the Global North compensate African nations for its historic greenhouse gas emissions, which have catalysed global warming, the summit embraced policies that will further hurt African nations. Its declaration focused heavily on – and legitimised – problematic practices like carbon credits, offsetting, and trading. These are false solutions and they are not what Africa needs. They constitute a neocolonial tactic that allows the Global North to continue to emit greenhouse gases whilе retaining control over African land and people and taking the credit for African emissions reductions. Carbon trading is based on the idea that emissions of carbon dioxide in one place can be “offset” by expanding carbon capture activities in another, such as planting new trees or protecting forests to allow for their natural regeneration. This allows the big carbon emitters of the Global North to pay nature-rich countries in the Global South to preserve or expand forested areas. But a lot of these areas are inhabited by local people who use forests and land for their livelihoods and food. Carbon trading schemes effectively banish the people from their homelands and dispossess them of their rights in the name of preservation and carbon capture. It has already been well-documented that such schemes are failing to address rising carbon emissions and enable the greenwashing of rich corporations and nations who refuse to reduce their emissions. If carbon trading is not the solution, then how can the Global North support African countries to finance loss and damage, adaptation and mitigation? Cap and share is one alternative model that is gaining popularity among climate activists and civil society. The system centres around an international carbon tax that would make polluters – including fossil fuel extractors and major consumers – in the Global North pay. This tax, applied to fossil fuel extraction, would raise trillions of dollars a year for a global Green New Deal fund, which would finance the transition to renewables and support energy access for all. The fund’s income would also provide grants for loss and damage, adaptation and mitigation in the Global South, as well as universal cash transfers to support ordinary people. Cap and share would establish a taxation system that operates beyond the nation-state; doing so is key for climate justice and in many ways, it is long overdue. Modelling suggests that the economic effects of a global carbon tax would be highly progressive, with Africa seeing substantial gains, including the permanent eradication of extreme poverty in all participating nations. This policy can be applied along with universal basic income and tax justice measures. As we move towards COP28, the mistakes of the Africa Climate Summit and other similar climate events should not be repeated. The voices of climate activists and civil society from the Global South need to be heard. We say no to carbon markets. We say no to selling Africa’s carbon, forests, and land to the North. We say yes to climate justice, and to climate finance that comes without strings attached.

pan african financial institution afreximbank poised launch 1b african film fund,Deadline,https://deadline.com/2023/11/pan-african-financial-institution-afreximbank-1-billion-dollar-african-film-fund-1235599337/,cairo based african export import bank also known afreximbank gearing launch 1b african film fund 2024 support continent burgeoning film industry kanayo awani executive vice president afreximbank intra african trade bank,cairo based african export import bank also known afreximbank gearing launch 1b african film fund 2024 support continent burgeoning film industry kanayo awani executiv 3436 chars,2023-11-10T14:20:45Z,"
	Cairo-based African Export-Import Bank, also known as Afreximbank, is gearing up to launch a $1B African Film Fund in 2024 to support the continent’s burgeoning film industry. 
	Kanayo Awani, Executive Vice President of Afreximbank’s Intra-African Trade Bank, announced the initiative in the opening speech of the 2023 Canex (Creative Africa Nexus) Summit in Cairo on Friday. 
	She said the fund would oversee film financing, co-finance with large studios, finance African filmmakers and finance producers and directors of film projects across the continent.

	Awani noted that Afreximbank had already announced the doubling of financing it was making available to the creative sector in Africa to $1B at the 2022 edition of Canex, and currently had $600M invested in film, music, visual arts, fashion, and sports projects.

	








 
	“The very first film we financed recently premiered at the Toronto Film Festival,” Awani said, adding, “The Bank has several in the pipeline from Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya, which should be on streaming platforms in 2024.”

 
	Awani said the film and audiovisual industries in Africa currently accounted for $5B of the African continent’s GDP and employed an estimated five million people, with the potential to create over 20 million jobs and generate $20B in revenues annually in the future. 
	She noted, however, that sector faced several challenges, including limited access to financing and copyright infringement due to weak copyright laws, enforcement mechanisms and a lack of awareness. 
	Other issues included infrastructure and technology gaps, lack of capacity and shortage of skilled professionals and limited market access and international exposure, as a result of which African creative and cultural products often struggle to gain exposure and access to international markets. 
	In an earlier address, German-Ghanian actor Boris Kodjoe, whose credits include Grey’s Anatomy and Station 19, told the summit that African creativity was increasingly influential on the world stage but that Africa faced branding challenges due to external perception fuelled by traditional media’s depiction of poverty, famine, civil wars and migration on the continent. 
	He said this could be on the cusp of changing with rising demand for culturally specific global content and quoted statistics suggesting that by 2030, Africa was projected to produce up to 10 per cent of global creative goods export worth roughly $200 billion or 4% of Africa’s GDP.

	








 
	H.E. Albert M. Muchanga, Commissioner for Trade and Industry of the African Union Commission, echoed these sentiments in another address. 
	“I reaffirm my belief that the African creative industry has huge potential to be a source of employment and revenue to create the Africa we want – revenue from intra-African trade as well as revenue from the rest of the world,” he said.  
	Muchanga urged African countries to convert its “vast potential’ into plans and projects that yielded tangible results, stressing the need to also invest in protecting international property rights. 
	Canex is an Afreximbank initiative aimed at supporting Africa and the African Diaspora’s creative and cultural industries by providing financing and non-financing instruments to boost growth.  
	The seven-day Canex Summit is taking place within the confines of IATF2023, Africa’s largest trade and investment fair, which is running from November 9 to 15 in Cairo. 
	Pan-African financial institution Afreximbank was created in 1993 under the auspices of the African Development Bank.  
	It is headquartered in Cairo and has regional offices in the capitals of Zimbabwe, the Ivory Coast, Uganda, Nigeria and Cameroon.

In November 2022, Ethiopia’s federal government and the rebellious authorities of Tigray agreed to a ceasefire during talks in South Africa after two years of bloodshed and atrocities that killed hundreds of thousands of people. With the guns silent at last, Ethiopia’s northern region has begun the task of rebuilding. “I am surprised how fast the situation changed in one year. … We are still far from pre-war, but it improved quite a bit,” said one member of a non-governmental organisation active in Tigray who requested anonymity to freely discuss the situation. The war, which also drew in Eritrean forces, inflicted terrible damage on the region. Ethiopian Finance Minister Ahmed Shide recently estimated the cost of reconstruction in the battle-scarred north at $20bn. Outside Tigray’s capital, Mekele, the restoration of electricity, telecommunications and banking services has been “very slow and gradual”, said a teacher at a university in the region who asked not to be identified. Close to 90 percent of Tigray’s health facilities were damaged or destroyed in the conflict, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report. “Health facilities were looted. For some, you only still have a shell, a concrete shell,” the NGO worker said.","the war inflicted terrible damage on the region. the restoration of electricity, telecommunications and banking services has been “very slow and gradual” a teacher in the region asked not to be identified.",very negative,Environment,Politics,Technology,0

 At the COP27 summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, an agreement to establish a loss and damage fund was hailed as a major breakthrough on one of the trickiest topics in the UN climate change negotiations. In an otherwise frustrating conference, this decision in November 2022 acknowledged the help that poorer and low-emitting countries in particular need to deal with the consequences of climate change—and, tentatively, who ought to pay.

										  
											        






This following year has seen more extreme weather records broken. Torrential rains created flooding which swept away an entire city in Libya, while wildfires razed swathes of Canada, Greece and the Hawaiian island of Maui.
As these events become routine worldwide, the case grows for an effective fund that can be set up quickly and help those most vulnerable to climate change. But after a year of talks, the fund has, so far, failed to materialize in the way that developing countries had hoped.
I'm writing a book on UN governance of loss and damage, and have been following the negotiations since 2013. Here's what happened after the negotiators went home and what to watch out for when they return, this time at COP28 in Dubai.
Big questions
Many questions were raised and left unresolved in Sharm El-Sheikh. Among them: who will pay into this new fund? Where will it sit? Who will have power over it? And who will have access to the funding (and who won't)?
A transitional committee with 14 developing country members and 10 developed country members was appointed by the UN to debate these questions after COP27. The committee has met regularly over the last year, but at its fourth meeting at the end of October—scheduled as the last session—important questions surrounding the fund, such as who should host and administer it, remained. Discussions broke down without an agreement.
In early November, less than a month before COP28, a hastily arranged fifth meeting presented committee members with a text cobbled together by the two co-chairs from South Africa and Finland as a take-it-or-leave-it agreement. Developing countries agreed to having the fund hosted by the World Bank for an interim period, despite reservations.
Developed countries also objected to the final text. The US wanted to add the adjective ""voluntary"" to any mention of contributions to the fund. Others argued that the pool of contributors to the fund should be widened to include some developing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, and also private sources of finance. These objections were noted but the text was adopted without them.
These recommendations must now be signed off at COP28, which begins on November 30. With almost 200 countries having to reach agreement on these arrangements and dissatisfaction widespread, the process isn't likely to be straightforward.


											  													    





The world's bank?
Developing countries have been skeptical of the World Bank as a potential host of the fund for several reasons.
Many delegates worry about the bank's reputation, including the dominance of developed country donors, its emphasis on providing loans rather than grants, and the lack of climate-savviness in the bank's operations. These concerns are likely to reemerge in Dubai.
The US is the biggest shareholder in the World Bank and traditionally, the bank's president has been a US citizen nominated by Washington. Small-island developing states (among the most vulnerable to climate change due to sea-level rise) have argued for moving the fund away from a donor-recipient model, with all their usual power imbalances, towards a partnership founded on a shared commitment to protecting the planet.
This will require partial or total reform of the World Bank—and some argue this is already happening under its new president. But hosting the fund within the bank would still give donor countries disproportionate influence, despite recommendations by the transitional committee that the fund's governing board be composed of a majority of developing country members.
High overhead costs are another concern. One board member of another fund hosted by the World Bank has suggested that the administrative fees the bank charges are rising and absorbing a larger share of aid. This could mean that, for every US$100 billion offered to countries and communities reeling from disaster, the World Bank will keep $US1.5 billion. This will be hard for an institution still funding the climate-wrecking oil and gas industry to justify.
The types of finance made available by the fund will need to be at odds with the bank's traditional mode of loan financing, by offering grants and other forms of highly concessional lending. Developing countries have consistently argued that loss and damage funding should not increase a developing country's debt burden.
The agreed text says the loss and damage fund will ""invite financial contributions"", with developed countries expected to ""take the lead"". Developing countries want developed nations (as the largest historical emitters) to provide funding, but rich nations have pushed back against any notion that they have an obligation to pay.
Rather, while making all the right noises on climate finance, they may gain short-term kudos by simply rebranding existing forms of climate finance or development aid, rather than offering any new money.
The compensation taboo
One thing you're unlikely to hear at COP28 is ""compensation"". While newspaper editors love headlines about reparations, liability and compensation when reporting on loss and damage, and a rise in climate litigation is making governments and polluting companies nervous, this language is still totally absent in discussion of the issue in the negotiations.
In fact, research has shown that mentions of compensation in state submissions to the UN declined dramatically after the establishment of the mechanism on loss and damage in 2013. The fine print of the 2015 Paris Agreement noted that loss and damage was ""not a basis for liability or compensation"".
I have noticed a taboo emerging around the term within the COP process. Instead, countries are increasingly opting for language such as ""solidarity"" as the basis for finance. These word choices show where power lies.
All of this is to sound a note of caution going into COP28. Major agreements on loss and damage have historically not lived up to their promises due to bureaucratic forum-shifting (moving topics to venues outside of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), delays, and under-resourcing. The adaptation fund was established in 2001 but only approved its first funding in 2010.
How is the urgent need for support among vulnerable communities and countries going to be met when the pace of progress within the climate change negotiations is glacial at best, and tends to be particularly slow and unambitious on loss and damage finance?
At COP28, making the loss and damage fund real is a litmus test for the legitimacy of the entire climate change negotiation regime.

 Many questions were raised and left unresolved in Sharm El-Sheikh. Among them: who will pay into this new fund? Where will it sit? Who will have power over it? And who will have access to the funding (and who won't)?
A transitional committee with 14 developing country members and 10 developed country members was appointed by the UN to debate these questions after COP27. The committee has met regularly over the last year, but at its fourth meeting at the end of October—scheduled as the last session—important questions surrounding the fund, such as who should host and administer it, remained. Discussions broke down without an agreement.
In early November, less than a month before COP28, a hastily arranged fifth meeting presented committee members with a text cobbled together by the two co-chairs from South Africa and Finland as a take-it-or-leave-it agreement. Developing countries agreed to having the fund hosted by the World Bank for an interim period, despite reservations.
Developed countries also objected to the final text. The US wanted to add the adjective ""voluntary"" to any mention of contributions to the fund. Others argued that the pool of contributors to the fund should be widened to include some developing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, and also private sources of finance. These objections were noted but the text was adopted without them.
These recommendations must now be signed off at COP28, which begins on November 30. With almost 200 countries having to reach agreement on these arrangements and dissatisfaction widespread, the process isn't likely to be straightforward.


											  													    





The world's bank?
Developing countries have been skeptical of the World Bank as a potential host of the fund for several reasons.
Many delegates worry about the bank's reputation, including the dominance of developed country donors, its emphasis on providing loans rather than grants, and the lack of climate-savviness in the bank's operations. These concerns are likely to reemerge in Dubai.
The US is the biggest shareholder in the World Bank and traditionally, the bank's president has been a US citizen nominated by Washington. Small-island developing states (among the most vulnerable to climate change due to sea-level rise) have argued for moving the fund away from a donor-recipient model, with all their usual power imbalances, towards a partnership founded on a shared commitment to protecting the planet.
This will require partial or total reform of the World Bank—and some argue this is already happening under its new president. But hosting the fund within the bank would still give donor countries disproportionate influence, despite recommendations by the transitional committee that the fund's governing board be composed of a majority of developing country members.
High overhead costs are another concern. One board member of another fund hosted by the World Bank has suggested that the administrative fees the bank charges are rising and absorbing a larger share of aid. This could mean that, for every US$100 billion offered to countries and communities reeling from disaster, the World Bank will keep $US1.5 billion. This will be hard for an institution still funding the climate-wrecking oil and gas industry to justify.
The types of finance made available by the fund will need to be at odds with the bank's traditional mode of loan financing, by offering grants and other forms of highly concessional lending. Developing countries have consistently argued that loss and damage funding should not increase a developing country's debt burden.
The agreed text says the loss and damage fund will ""invite financial contributions"", with developed countries expected to ""take the lead"". Developing countries want developed nations (as the largest historical emitters) to provide funding, but rich nations have pushed back against any notion that they have an obligation to pay.
Rather, while making all the right noises on climate finance, they may gain short-term kudos by simply rebranding existing forms of climate finance or development aid, rather than offering any new money.
The compensation taboo
One thing you're unlikely to hear at COP28 is ""compensation"". While newspaper editors love headlines about reparations, liability and compensation when reporting on loss and damage, and a rise in climate litigation is making governments and polluting companies nervous, this language is still totally absent in discussion of the issue in the negotiations.
In fact, research has shown that mentions of compensation in state submissions to the UN declined dramatically after the establishment of the mechanism on loss and damage in 2013. The fine print of the 2015 Paris Agreement noted that loss and damage was ""not a basis for liability or compensation"".
I have noticed a taboo emerging around the term within the COP process. Instead, countries are increasingly opting for language such as ""solidarity"" as the basis for finance. These word choices show where power lies.
All of this is to sound a note of caution going into COP28. Major agreements on loss and damage have historically not lived up to their promises due to bureaucratic forum-shifting (moving topics to venues outside of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), delays, and under-resourcing. The adaptation fund was established in 2001 but only approved its first funding in 2010.
How is the urgent need for support among vulnerable communities and countries going to be met when the pace of progress within the climate change negotiations is glacial at best, and tends to be particularly slow and unambitious on loss and damage finance?
At COP28, making the loss and damage fund real is a litmus test for the legitimacy of the entire climate change negotiation regime.

 The US is the biggest shareholder in the World Bank and traditionally, the bank's president has been a US citizen nominated by Washington. Small-island developing states (among the most vulnerable to climate change due to sea-level rise) have argued for moving the fund away from a donor-recipient model, with all their usual power imbalances, towards a partnership founded on a shared commitment to protecting the planet.
This will require partial or total reform of the World Bank—and some argue this is already happening under its new president. But hosting the fund within the bank would still give donor countries disproportionate influence, despite recommendations by the transitional committee that the fund's governing board be composed of a majority of developing country members.
High overhead costs are another concern. One board member of another fund hosted by the World Bank has suggested that the administrative fees the bank charges are rising and absorbing a larger share of aid. This could mean that, for every US$100 billion offered to countries and communities reeling from disaster, the World Bank will keep $US1.5 billion. This will be hard for an institution still funding the climate-wrecking oil and gas industry to justify.
The types of finance made available by the fund will need to be at odds with the bank's traditional mode of loan financing, by offering grants and other forms of highly concessional lending. Developing countries have consistently argued that loss and damage funding should not increase a developing country's debt burden.
The agreed text says the loss and damage fund will ""invite financial contributions"", with developed countries expected to ""take the lead"". Developing countries want developed nations (as the largest historical emitters) to provide funding, but rich nations have pushed back against any notion that they have an obligation to pay.
Rather, while making all the right noises on climate finance, they may gain short-term kudos by simply rebranding existing forms of climate finance or development aid, rather than offering any new money.
The compensation taboo
One thing you're unlikely to hear at COP28 is ""compensation"". While newspaper editors love headlines about reparations, liability and compensation when reporting on loss and damage, and a rise in climate litigation is making governments and polluting companies nervous, this language is still totally absent in discussion of the issue in the negotiations.
In fact, research has shown that mentions of compensation in state submissions to the UN declined dramatically after the establishment of the mechanism on loss and damage in 2013. The fine print of the 2015 Paris Agreement noted that loss and damage was ""not a basis for liability or compensation"".
I have noticed a taboo emerging around the term within the COP process. Instead, countries are increasingly opting for language such as ""solidarity"" as the basis for finance. These word choices show where power lies.
All of this is to sound a note of caution going into COP28. Major agreements on loss and damage have historically not lived up to their promises due to bureaucratic forum-shifting (moving topics to venues outside of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), delays, and under-resourcing. The adaptation fund was established in 2001 but only approved its first funding in 2010.

It follows a year of extreme weather events in which many climate records have been broken.  COP28 is the 28th annual United Nations (UN) climate meeting where governments will discuss how to limit and prepare for future climate change. The summit is being held in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), from 30 November until 12 December 2023. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", where the ""parties"" are the countries that signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992.  The UAE is one of the world's top 10 oil-producing nations.  It has appointed the chief executive of the state-owned oil company, Sultan Al Jaber, president of the COP28 talks. Oil - like gas and coal - is a fossil fuel. These are the main causes of climate change because they release planet-warming greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide when burned for energy. But Mr Al Jaber's oil company plans to expand production capacity.  ""It is the equivalent of appointing the CEO of a cigarette company to oversee a conference on cancer cures,"" campaign group 350.org said. Mr Al Jaber argues he is uniquely well-placed to push for action from the oil and gas industry, and that as chairman of renewable energy firm Masdar, he has also overseen the expansion of clean technologies like wind and solar power. It is hoped COP28 will help keep alive the goal of limiting long-term global temperature rises to 1.5C. This was agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015. The 1.5C target is crucial to avoid the most damaging impacts of climate change, according to the UN's climate body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Long-term warming currently stands at about 1.1C or 1.2C compared with pre-industrial times - the period before humans started burning fossil fuels at scale. However, the world is on track for about 2.5C of warming by 2100 even with current pledges to tackle emissions. The window for keeping the 1.5C limit in reach ""rapidly narrowing"", the UN says.  As well as progress towards the existing Paris goals, COP28 will concentrate on: There will also be themed days on issues including health, finance, food and nature. More than 200 governments are invited, although the leaders of many countries such as the US, China and India are still to confirm their attendance.  UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will take part, and Buckingham Palace has confirmed that King Charles will also attend. He will deliver an opening address to delegates on 1 December.  Environmental charities, community groups, think tanks, businesses and faith groups will also take part. Hundreds of delegates with links to fossil fuels attended COP27 in 2022. There is likely to be disagreement about the future of ""unabated"" fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas which are burned without technologies to capture their emissions. Mr Al Jaber has called for a ""phase down"" in their use, meaning a reduction over time, but not a complete end. However, the European Union is expected to push for a full ""phase out"".  Climate campaigners point out that restricting agreements to ""unabated"" fossil fuels would allow some production to continue. They say there is no guarantee capturing emissions will work at scale. Money will also be an issue.  At COP27, a ""loss and damage"" fund was agreed for richer countries to pay poorer countries facing the effects of climate change. But exactly how this will work is still unclear. The US, for example, has ruled out paying climate reparations for its historical emissions.  In 2009, developed countries committed to give $100bn (£82bn) a year, by 2020, to developing countries to help them reduce emissions and prepare for climate change. The target was missed but is expected to be reached in 2023. Critics of previous COPs, including campaigner Greta Thunberg, accuse the summits of ""greenwashing"": that is, countries and businesses promote their climate credentials without making the changes needed. But as world leaders gather, the summits offer potential for global agreements that go beyond national measures. For example, the 1.5C warming limit, agreed in Paris at COP21, has driven ""near-universal climate action"", according to the UN. Additional reporting by Esme Stallard.","COP28 is the 28th annual united nations climate meeting. the summit is being held in the united arab emirates (UAE) from 30 November until 12 December 2023. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties,"" where the ""parties"" are the countries signed up to the original UN climate agreement in 1992.",positive,Technology,Technology,Politics,3

	Lupita Nyong’o has joined Goodbye Julia, Sudan’s entry for this year’s Best International feature race at the Oscars, as an executive producer. 
	Directed by Sudanese filmmaker Mohamed Kordofani in his feature film debut, the pic explores the events leading up the 2011 split between Sudan’s southern and northern populations. The film made history in Cannes this year as the first Sudanese film to play in the festival after it was selected for Un Certain Regard. 
	The film’s Cannes premiere took place just weeks after fighting broke out in Khartoum due to a clash between rival generals, which has led to the deaths of 5,000 people and uprooted seven million people.

	Since Cannes, the film has also played at Karlovy Vary in its Horizons section and had been set to make its MENA premiere at Egypt’s El Gouna Film Festival in October ahead of a theatrical release in the country on October 25. The fest was subsequently postponed due to the Israel-Hamar conflict. Goodbye Julia was also selected for the BFI London Film Festival.

 
	The film stars Eiman Yousif and Sudanese model Siran Riak, in her big screen acting debut; and also features South Sudanese actor and activist Ger Duany who is known for his work supporting refugees from the region. 
	“Goodbye Julia is a powerful representation of the conflict happening in Sudan right now, which affects millions of lives across Eastern Africa,” Nyong’o said. “Mohamed Kordofani and the filmmakers present the issues in a beautiful, deeply personal way. I’m honored to lend my voice to help bring this film’s message to the world.” 
Goodbye Julia is represented in North America by CAA Media Finance. The film is produced by Amjad Abu Alala, creator of Station Films, and Co-Produced by Ali Alarabi, the founder and CEO of Egyptian American production company Ambient Light Films. Amjad Abu Alala directed Sudan’s first ever Academy Awards submission You Will Die at Twenty in 2019, which Mohamed Kordofani worked on as well.

 Threats posed by the climate crisis disproportionally affect certain communities and social groups that are more exposed. People living in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries are at heightened risk. Within these countries, women typically face higher climate risk than men.

										 											      






To show where women working in agri-food systems—systems that encompass production, but also post-harvest handling and distribution—are most threated by climate change, an international team of researchers has developed a hotspot map that identifies and ranks localities by threat level.
""We show that significant climate hazards, high exposure faced by women in agri-food systems, and high vulnerability faced by women due to systemic gender inequalities converge particularly in central, east, and southern Africa, as well as in west and south Asia,"" said the study's first author Dr. Els Lecoutere, who is a researcher at the CGIAR GENDER Impact Platform in Kenya.
""The maps are potentially impactful as they can inform decision- and policymaking around gender-responsive climate action and guide the allocation of scarce resources to populations at highest risk,"" Lecoutere added.
The results were published in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems.

Hotspots for different reasons
""The climate-agriculture-gender inequality hotspot risk index captures the convergence of climate hazards, exposure, and vulnerability because of gender inequalities faced by women in agri-food systems,"" said Lecoutere. The team of researchers involved in the study calculated each country's risk based on these indicators. ""We plotted the resulting 'hotness' score for each LMIC country into a color-coded map, which makes it possible to compare and contrast risks in different countries.""
The researchers also applied their methodology within four LMIC countries: Bangladesh, Pakistan, Zambia, and Mali. In the global ranking, they took places 2, 4, 13, and 18, respectively. Multiple drivers of risk contributed to these rankings.
""For the two focus countries in Asia, high climate hazards and women farmers' exposure drives climate risks, whereas in the two focus countries in Africa structural inequalities play a larger role,"" Lecoutere explained.
In Mali and Zambia, secondary resources confirm that women are restricted by norms that hinder their access to land ownership, information, and economic empowerment—limitations that negatively affect their ability to adapt to climate hazards. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, women contribute significantly to agricultural activities, but do so mostly informally. Their work often remains unrecognized, unpaid, or underpaid, which leaves them dependent on agriculture, and vulnerable to the adverse aftereffects of ever more frequent and severe climate hazards.

Starting points for policymaking
The researchers pointed to certain limitations of their study, for example a lack of data that has made it impossible to calculate a 'hotness' score for some countries, including small island development states. Yet, it is often these locations that are the most poverty- or conflict-stricken, and therefore vulnerable, making it plausible that women in these environments face significant climate risks.
While the team pointed out that in some cases data might not be available or sufficiently recent to be effectively used for policy making, their findings offer insights for other localities. One possible starting point is reducing women's sensitivity to harm from climate hazards by addressing systemic gender inequalities and supporting the adaptive capacities of all agri-food system actors in gender-responsive ways.
""Another key use for the results of our study is the upcoming COP28 and ongoing negotiations around a loss and damage fund, and other climate investments. The hotspot maps can help decisionmakers and investors target finance and investments to the areas where women are hardest hit from climate change risks,"" Lecoutere pointed out.

 ""The maps are potentially impactful as they can inform decision- and policymaking around gender-responsive climate action and guide the allocation of scarce resources to populations at highest risk,"" Lecoutere added.
The results were published in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems.

Hotspots for different reasons
""The climate-agriculture-gender inequality hotspot risk index captures the convergence of climate hazards, exposure, and vulnerability because of gender inequalities faced by women in agri-food systems,"" said Lecoutere. The team of researchers involved in the study calculated each country's risk based on these indicators. ""We plotted the resulting 'hotness' score for each LMIC country into a color-coded map, which makes it possible to compare and contrast risks in different countries.""
The researchers also applied their methodology within four LMIC countries: Bangladesh, Pakistan, Zambia, and Mali. In the global ranking, they took places 2, 4, 13, and 18, respectively. Multiple drivers of risk contributed to these rankings.
""For the two focus countries in Asia, high climate hazards and women farmers' exposure drives climate risks, whereas in the two focus countries in Africa structural inequalities play a larger role,"" Lecoutere explained.
In Mali and Zambia, secondary resources confirm that women are restricted by norms that hinder their access to land ownership, information, and economic empowerment—limitations that negatively affect their ability to adapt to climate hazards. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, women contribute significantly to agricultural activities, but do so mostly informally. Their work often remains unrecognized, unpaid, or underpaid, which leaves them dependent on agriculture, and vulnerable to the adverse aftereffects of ever more frequent and severe climate hazards.

Starting points for policymaking
The researchers pointed to certain limitations of their study, for example a lack of data that has made it impossible to calculate a 'hotness' score for some countries, including small island development states. Yet, it is often these locations that are the most poverty- or conflict-stricken, and therefore vulnerable, making it plausible that women in these environments face significant climate risks.
While the team pointed out that in some cases data might not be available or sufficiently recent to be effectively used for policy making, their findings offer insights for other localities. One possible starting point is reducing women's sensitivity to harm from climate hazards by addressing systemic gender inequalities and supporting the adaptive capacities of all agri-food system actors in gender-responsive ways.
""Another key use for the results of our study is the upcoming COP28 and ongoing negotiations around a loss and damage fund, and other climate investments. The hotspot maps can help decisionmakers and investors target finance and investments to the areas where women are hardest hit from climate change risks,"" Lecoutere pointed out.

Known as the ZA IT Hub, the digital hub was conceived several years ago in response to the escalating demand for IT professionals in Munich. The capital of Bavaria faced a severe talent shortage due to the rapid pace of digitalization. The decision to establish the hub in South Africa was driven by the need to diversify and broaden the network, leveraging the international presence of the company. With operations spanning 77 countries, the hub plays a pivotal role in delivering BMW’s services to a worldwide audience.  The ZA IT Hub handles the development of internal BMW systems and digital platforms and is involved in all core BMW Group business processes, finance and sales. Initially, the South African IT office offered limited SAP services to the BMW Brilliance Automotive JV in China. It started with 134 employees in 2014 and reached 635 employees in 2019 . Today, there are more than 2,300 employees in the hub.  “Collaboration is a cornerstone of the hub’s success,” Thorsten Achenbach as director of digital and global solutions told media during an office tour. “Beyond just being a center for delivering services, the hub actively engages in collaborative efforts with Munich and other German locations. The emphasis is on a two-way exchange of knowledge, where employees from South Africa spend time in Munich to understand BMW processes, and vice versa,” he added. Despite being a major employer in the area, the BMW ZA IT Hub is still facing difficulties attracting top talent. To mitigate that, the hub employs innovative recruitment strategies, such as the “tech talent day,” where potential hires are brought together for a weekend of integration. This approach enables the company to assess not only technical skills but also how well candidates integrate into the team, streamlining the hiring process.  The BMW Digital Twin involves creating a digital representation of each physical vehicle produced by BMW, capturing and integrating data throughout the vehicle’s entire lifecycle. This digital counterpart, often referred to as the “digital twin,” encompasses information about the vehicle’s hardware, software, and various features. The initiative aims to leverage this digital representation for a variety of purposes, with a particular emphasis on contributing to the circular economy and addressing sustainability challenges in the automotive industry.  The BMW Digital Twin involves collecting data from various sources, including production systems, internal databases, and potentially external suppliers. One of the primary goals of the Digital Twin is to contribute to BMW’s sustainability targets and promote the circular economy. By documenting the materials and components of each vehicle, the digital twin enables informed decision-making regarding recycling, reusing, or repurposing materials, thereby reducing environmental impact.  Imagine a use case where you can have granular data about the battery’s chemical composition, including detailed state of charge information, and then using that data to recommend it for a secondary use or sending it to a dismantling center. Other use cases range from meeting regulatory requirements for vehicle exports (China, for example) to contributing to sustainability goals. By documenting the materials and components of each vehicle, the digital twin enables informed decision-making regarding recycling, reusing, or repurposing materials, thereby reducing environmental impact. The BMW Digital Twin explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance decision-making processes, especially at the end of a vehicle’s life. Potential future capabilities include creating forecasts of the monetary value of vehicles based on their materials, enabling better resource management. Neue Klasse will be at the center of the Digital Twin after it arrives in 2025.  Achenbach also underscores the voluntary contributions made by employees toward social causes. Whether it’s collecting clothes for donation or supporting local schools, employees actively participate in initiatives that extend beyond the scope of their professional duties, showcasing a commitment to corporate social responsibility. According to Achenbach, the ZA IT Hub contributed 3.3 billion Rand (approx. $176 million) to the South African economy in 2023. In addition, the hub is involved in educational initiatives. Achenbach mentions the involvement with the Harambee Foundation, highlighting the hub’s role in educating and preparing individuals for the workforce. The hub’s impact is not solely measured in business metrics; it extends to the broader community. Through environmental initiatives like tree planting and support for a rhino orphanage, the hub demonstrates a commitment to making a positive impact on both society and the environment.  The ZA IT Hub control center handles various issues, from printer and application problems to server or infrastructure issues. The IT Control Center operates 24/7 in three shifts and supports multiple languages, including German, English, and Spanish. The support team follows a two-level resolution process, with the first level being a quick fix from their knowledge base and the second level involving specialists analyzing and resolving tickets. To deal with the daily load shedding, the IT Control Center runs on backup generators which ensure a continuous operational program. They also mentioned proactive monitoring to identify and address issues before they cause production stoppages. Additionally, Sonichu discussed the center’s involvement in a youth program, collaborating with schools to train graduates and integrate them into the IT support team. Finally, the presentation included a map illustrating the locations supported by the IT Control Center, emphasizing their continuous availability for support. The office will soon be restricted for external tours due to security reasons. The presentation concluded with an invitation for questions. The IT Control Center of the ZA Hub collaborates with schools, including the Pretoria German School and the Driehoek German School, for a Youth for Youth Program. The center enrolls graduates from these schools into the control center, providing them with training, exposure to processes, and participation in IT courses to enhance their skills.  Our final leg of the office visit takes us through the UI/UX departments where we get a look behind the scenes at the design operations particularly highlighting their collaboration with team members from Germany, Portugal, and South Africa. The team’s responsibility is to ensure that all product teams adhere to the correct principles in UX design for all global markets. A ZA IT Hub engineer explains that their focus is on creating business solutions for internal employees. For example, they utilize Eye Tracking technology to understand the user journey through the software they develop. The process involves tasks designed by the software development team, eye tracking studies with a target audience, and usability tests. The collected data, including eye tracking results, is used to create reports with actionable recommendations for improving software quality. Essentially, a pair of glasses equipped with infrared lights and cameras are tracking the reflection from users’ pupils. A live demo showcases the infrared lights and the resulting data on a heat map, indicating areas of intense fixation. The importance of heat maps lies in understanding where users concentrate their gaze. This information helps identify whether crucial elements, such as a submit button, are getting attention. Of course, this is just one of the many areas of expertise within the hub, but from a non-tech media perspective, this is a more interesting one and easier to digest than hardcore tech topics. As we wrap up the tour, one thing becomes clear: beyond the apparent business benefits for global markets, the BMW IT Hub holds a personal mission. It’s not just about advancing in the tech realm; it’s about making a difference in South Africa’s social fabric. This means not only equipping young South Africans with vital IT skills but also preparing them for the challenges of tomorrow’s job market. Moreover, there’s a heartfelt commitment to tackling the concerning unemployment rates among those aged 18-34, turning this initiative into a meaningful effort that goes beyond corporate boundaries.",BMW ZA IT Hub is the oldest and largest of three IT Hubs within the BMW Group. the hub was conceived several years ago in response to the escalating demand for IT professionals in Munich. the hub plays a pivotal role in delivering BMW’s services to a worldwide audience.,very positive,Environment,Politics,Technology,4

The extensive fair is taking place at the Russia International Exhibition and Forum in Moscow. According to Siluanov, the global process of power redistribution is already underway. “The old systems are becoming obsolete, new forces are coming, new economies are emerging – China, Russia, India. The East is actively developing, and the old economies that previously dominated, both economically and politically, are gradually deflating,” he stated, noting that such “changes always happen painfully.” The minister argued that the West “clings to methods such as using their currencies as weapons to hold other economies back.” As a result, in order to “preserve the old order” with sanctions, Western countries primarily harm their own economies, he said, while “new economies are growing faster, new forces and muscles of countries are increasing and politically they are becoming more powerful.” According to Siluanov, emerging economies predictably want to influence global economic processes without having to obey Western countries, or the ‘golden billion’. BRICS, the minister stated, is a viable alternative to the existing Western economic system. The bloc currently includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, but they will be joined by Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE in January. The enlarged BRICS will represent 37% of global GDP, more than the G7, which stands at 29.9%. Russia has repeatedly called for a multilateral world order, with President Vladimir Putin accusing the West of pursuing “a colonial approach” and bending the international rules to its will. His statements have begun to ring much louder over the past several months, as Russia faces unprecedented economic sanctions from the West over its conflict with Ukraine. Due to these restrictions, Russia has effectively been deprived of the ability to conduct international transactions in dollars and euros, and has lost access to the Western banking system. However, despite the downturn the country’s economy suffered due to the restrictions last year, it has now largely recovered thanks to redirecting trade to the East and increasing the share of national currencies in cross-border settlements. European countries, meanwhile, have been struggling with soaring inflation, a cost-of-living crisis, and a downturn in industrial production – problems that were intensified by the sanctions on Moscow which deprived the bloc of Russian energy supplies. Many Western politicians have been calling for an end to the sanctions, arguing that they have backfired.

decade old broken climate promise looms cop28,Grist,http://grist.org/international/international-climate-finance-adaptation/,new data suggest wealthy countries may belatedly providing promised 100 billion climate related aid eroded trust process,collapse negotiations 2009 united nations climate conference copenhagen denmark repercussions shaped international climate finance day rich countries like th 12814 chars,2023-11-17T09:45:00Z,"The collapse of negotiations at the 2009 United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, had repercussions that have shaped international climate finance to this day. Rich countries like the United States and much of Europe, which are responsible for the vast majority of historical carbon emissions, refused to back a strong commitment to limit global warming, despite the furious objections of poorer nations who were already suffering from the effects of climate change.  Instead, as a kind of consolation prize, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a vague promise to ramp up aid for decarbonization and disaster response in less fortunate countries around the world. She proposed that wealthy nations would send $100 billion in climate finance to poorer nations every year by 2020. The $100 billion number was far below the true need in those poorer nations, but it was adopted by negotiators and today is still the largest-ever financial commitment for climate change. More than a decade later, developed countries only now seem to be fulfilling that promise. Preliminary data revealed this week in a new report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, indicate that the $100 billion goal may have finally been met in 2022. However, this comes after the countries blew through their initial 2020 deadline; in 2021, wealthy nations only provided around $90 billion of climate finance to the developing world, even as climate-driven disasters wreak havoc on poorer nations in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The United States in particular is lagging behind. If it was to pay a share equivalent to its historical carbon emissions, the country would be responsible for nearly half of the $100 billion; it has contributed just a fraction of that.

Here's How The majority of the funding provided still comes in the form of loans that developing nations must repay. Wealthy nations have also spent far more money on climate mitigation projects like solar farms than they have on adaptation projects to protect against floods and famines, leaving poor countries vulnerable to climate disasters even as they take steps to emit less than countries that developed earlier. Adaptation funding decreased in 2021 by 14 percent compared to 2020 and made up just a quarter of the $90 billion, according to the OECD report. Critics also say that some money tagged as climate aid has in fact funded projects that have nothing to do with climate change. “We are very disappointed with the ambition from richer nations,” said Isatou Camara, a development planner for the finance ministry of the Gambia and a climate negotiator for a coalition of the least economically developed countries. “What we’ve been hearing from them was that they don’t have the resources to actually fulfill this commitment, but really there’s a lack of political will.” She pointed out that wealthy countries spent billions of dollars on domestic relief at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as they were lagging behind on their international commitments.

 The shortcomings of the $100 billion pledge have eroded trust between the developed world and the developing world, altering the tenor of conversations about climate aid. Even with indications that the goal was likely met in 2022 — two years behind schedule — wealthy nations have a long way to go to rebuild trust with countries in the Global South.  “Showing that we have met [the $100 billion] goal is an important milestone, but that’s what it is — it’s a milestone,” said Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s climate minister, at a press conference discussing the report. “It doesn’t solve all of our problems. The conversation needs to shift. We’ve mobilized $100 billion. How do you mobilize a trillion dollars?” Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How Negotiators are now trying to work out a new and more ambitious funding pledge, one that would funnel much more money to developing countries and would guarantee grant support for climate adaptation projects, but mistrust is making it more difficult than ever to reach a consensus. The deadline for agreeing on a new goal is next year, and the progress of negotiations at COP28, the United Nations climate conference later this month in Dubai, will have huge implications for developing countries’ efforts to survive climate change. Grants are still a small portion of the funding available to poorer nations, according to the OECD, which maintains the most comprehensive accounting of international climate finance. In 2021, wealthy nations provided about $20 billion in grants and nearly $50 billion in loans. The largest recipients of this funding are middle-income countries like India, Bangladesh, and Turkey, where fossil fuel consumption is rising — and where rich countries are investing in renewable energy projects. A much smaller share of money went to countries in sub-Saharan Africa or island states in the Pacific, which emit less carbon but suffer billions of dollars in damages from climate disasters each year, thanks to extreme weather, drought, and sea-level rise. This lopsided aid landscape is due to the vagueness of the original Copenhagen pledge from 2009. The language of the treaty called for funding to be “new and additional,” but there was no clarity on what that meant, raising the risk that countries would reclassify existing aid to meet their obligations. Nor was there any mechanism for keeping track of who had donated what, or confirming whether a given contribution was “new and additional.”  Furthermore, there were few guidelines about how countries should send money or what kinds of projects they should fund. The pledge said that money should “come from a wide variety of sources” and “address the needs of developing countries,” but there was almost no detail beyond that. Many countries ended up tagging donations as climate-related when they had nothing to do with addressing global warming, and a good deal of obligated money never funded climate projects at all. A Reuters investigation earlier this year found that money tagged toward the $100 billion goal had helped open a new coal plant in Bangladesh; other funds had financed the expansion of an Italian gelato chain. “There’s a lot of mistrust that they over-report,” said Pieter Pauw, a climate finance expert at the German Institute of Development and Sustainability, a think tank focused on international development. “I’ve heard of a basketball field in the Philippines being accounted for as climate finance, and you really wonder: How?”  The larger problem for developing countries is that rich countries have sent most of their aid through interest-bearing loans, albeit often at “concessional” interest rates that are lower than they would be on the private market. Japan, for instance, has been one of the largest contributors of climate finance to the developing world, far surpassing the United States, but almost all its donations have been loans rather than grants. “It’s because they’re not really committed,” said Iolanda Fresnillo, a finance expert at the European Network on Debt and Development, an organization that advocates for debt relief. “If you’re not really committed, then you will choose loans, because that will have a smaller impact on your fiscal indicators. It’s an asset, it’s not a loss.”  Poorer countries have no choice but to take these loans if they want to invest in crucial projects to protect against disasters, but many of these countries are already overwhelmed by debt, and they often have to constrain domestic spending in order to service their loans, cutting funding for infrastructure or public services. Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados and a leading advocate for climate-vulnerable countries, has made the loans issue a centerpiece of her advocacy at recent United Nations talks, arguing that rich countries should provide climate money through no-strings-attached grants.  Avinash Persaud, Mottley’s climate envoy, said that Barbados’ climate costs are roughly 100 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. “We can’t increase our debt by 100 percent,” he said. “We need every way of raising affordable finance.” Developed countries’ reliance on loans has also resulted in a bias toward decarbonization projects rather than adaptation projects. When a rich country lends money to a poor country for a solar farm or a carbon sequestration project, it can expect that the project will generate financial returns, and that those returns will help the poor country repay the loan with interest. Private companies and lenders are also more likely to support projects that offer an investment return, allowing rich countries to mobilize more funds by blending public and private money. Even though an adaptation project such as a sea wall or a reservoir can help avoid economic damages from future disasters, the avoided damages don’t translate into a financial return for the borrowing country.  “If you look at the number of climate-related disasters we’ve been experiencing in our countries, it’s basically due to the inadequate resources we have to respond to the effects of climate change,” said Camara. “We’ve over and over been saying that adaptation is a key priority, and what we’ve ended up believing is that adaptation is not profitable.” Regardless of how close countries have come to meeting their commitments from 2009, the $100 billion pledge is nearing the end of its life. Back in 2018, before wealthy countries had even come close to meeting the Copenhagen promise, international negotiators agreed to start drafting a new goal that would funnel even more money to decarbonization and disaster response.  This revised goal, which negotiators need to finalize by next year’s United Nations conference, will likely set a much higher target for annual funding. In the years since Copenhagen, scientists have gotten much better at estimating future costs of climate-related losses, and most experts now believe that annual financing needs should be measured in the trillions rather than the billions of dollars. But just raising the target number on this “new collective quantified goal” (the United Nations’ terminology) may not be enough to ensure funding reaches those who need it. Developing countries and climate advocates are calling for a more structured commitment that would fix the vagueness of the Copenhagen pledge. This new goal would mandate that developed countries provide some portion of their funding through grants rather than loans, and would also set a minimum amount of funding for adaptation projects, which aren’t as attractive for lenders.  “There’s a push to provide more money than was provided in the past,” said Jan Kowalzig, a researcher at Oxfam who follows climate finance. “The amount depends on how you design it. We are arguing that there should be a sub-goal on adaptation, that would be about grant money only, but developed countries are very unlikely to accept that.” Developed countries have countered that they shouldn’t be the only ones sending money. The Copenhagen pledge applied only to the wealthiest and most developed countries, most notably the United States and the European Union, and it omitted fast-developing and high-emitting countries such as China and India, as well as petrostates like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. and other wealthy contributors are now pushing to include more countries in the donor pool, arguing that they have both the means and the moral responsibility to contribute, given the emissions increases that come as countries industrialize. These same questions are also looming over parallel talks over a separate “loss and damage” fund to compensate countries for losses incurred due to climate change, which is the other main focus of COP28. This fund, which negotiators agreed to create at last year’s climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, would offer compensation and rebuilding aid for unavoidable climate damages, rather than aid to help prepare for future disasters or ditch fossil fuels.  Here, too, developing countries are seeking strong financial guarantees from wealthy countries, and these states in turn are advocating for loans and other financial instruments rather than direct grants. The less money countries receive for adaptation funding to prevent future disasters, the more loss and damage funding they will need to recover from those disasters.   It remains to be seen how both sets of negotiations will shake out at COP28, but negotiators and outside observers say that developed countries are entering the conference with less leverage than ever. As Pauw sees it, wealthy nations’ failure to make good on their Copenhagen promise has all but ensured that they will end up paying enormous amounts of money in future years as climate impacts worsen. “I think failure backfires on developed countries,” said Pauw, of the German Development Institute. “It gives developing countries a lot of ammunition to demand more.” Naveena Sadasivam contributed reporting to this story.

emissions rich people problem,The New Republic,https://newrepublic.com/article/176558/emissions-rich-people-problem,1990 intergovernmental panel climate change released first report global warming started clock collective response three decades since humanity nations peoples corporations spewed ca,gordon brown former british prime minister campaigning small international tax oil gas export revenue william ruto president kenya calling ambitious pack 1925 chars,2023-11-06T11:00:00Z,"In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its first report on global warming—and by so doing started the clock on our collective response. In the three decades since then, humanity—as nations, peoples, and corporations—has spewed more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it had in all preceding history. There are primarily three groups to blame for this depressing fact. The first is the fossil fuel cartel, which is to say the coal and oil and gas companies. It goes without saying that fossil capital, some of it “sovereign” capital owned and controlled by nations and some of it just straight-up private capital, has done everything to ensure that we remain dependent on fossil fuels for as long as possible.  The second is the global north. A huge percentage of both current and historical emissions comes from North America and Europe, with the United States responsible for twice as many emissions as any other country. Admittedly, the world has changed since 1990: China’s “emergence,” for example, lifted more people out of poverty than any other event in human history, though it also released immense plumes of carbon dioxide. These emissions get a lot of attention in the U.S., and deservedly so, but the poverty alleviation does as well. And the “developed” countries of North America and Europe still account for about a third of post-1990 emissions.  The third is the Global Rich. This, not China’s rise, is the story that’s most crucial if we want to understand why our poor efforts at mitigation have been such unrelenting failures. It is impossible to appreciate the forces at work behind the past three decades of emissions without recognizing how many of these emissions belonged to the rich.  Forget, for a moment, your national identity. Consider inequality from an astronaut’s perspective. Imagine the earth and all the suffering on it. Think globally, as if there were no countries or borders, but only one great planetary pool of humans, which can be partitioned into nations, or races, or genders, or ethnic and religious communities. Or into classes—like “the global one percent”—defined by wealth, income, and emissions.  This is the global inequality approach that multiple schools of activist scholars—the World Inequality Lab is prominent among them, as is the Stockholm Environment Institute—use to illuminate the workings of the climate challenge. Typically, they frame their results in terms of three great global classes—the top 10 percent, the bottom 50 percent, and the remaining 40 percent, who are often called “the global middle class.” In 2021, the top 10 percent held 76 percent of the world’s wealth, while the middle 40 percent held 22 percent, and the rest of the world held just 2 percent. In this global inequality approach, one doesn’t compare the wealth of an average American to that of an average Chinese, or the emissions of an average Colombian to those of an average Russian. One ignores countries, at least initially, to reveal the bigger picture.  Global income distribution is significantly less polarized than wealth. The poorest half of humanity—the bottom 50 percent—enjoy a full 8.5 percent of global income, a dismal figure to be sure but still considerably more than their 2 percent of global wealth. Similarly, the world’s top 10 percent take 52 percent of the world’s total income, a figure that, while smaller than their 76 percent of total wealth, is still horrifying. And if you venture into the heights, where you find the top 5 percent, the top 1 percent, the top one-hundredth of the top 1 percent, you’ll see that the concentration of both wealth and income—and emissions as well—continue to intensify as you rise, in an almost fractal manner.  Because income and emissions are highly correlated, this approach allows us to better answer the question of why humanity’s cumulative emissions have doubled since the early years of the U.N. climate treaty. The Stockholm Environment Institute’s Carbon Inequality Era paper shows that, in the period since 1990, as emissions almost doubled, the rising consumption of the world’s top 10 percent was responsible for almost half of that increase—almost as much as the entire remaining 90 percent of the world’s population. The emissions of the richest 5 percent (37 percent of all post-1990 emissions) were particularly notable, and the emissions of the top 1 percent (who contributed 21 percent of all post-1990 emissions) were far greater still.  Many of us will live to see the consequences of this emissions growth, as the temperature begins a true overshoot (and not just a transient spike) above 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). To have a 50/50 chance of holding the 1.5-degree line, we have to limit emissions from the beginning of 2023 onward to about 250 metric gigatons of carbon dioxide. At current global emissions levels, that budget will be exhausted in 2029. But the world’s richest 10 percent would exhaust it on their own by about 2035, even if the rest of us were to cease emitting anything at all.  The problem isn’t just that wealthy people generate more carbon emissions than poor people. It’s that the sheer overwhelming extent to which they do so belies the endlessly repeated claim that rising fossil fuel consumption and even the destabilization of the climate system are justified by the need to lift the world’s poor from poverty.  The truth is that the poorer, energy-deprived half of the human population has barely contributed to, and barely benefited from, these past three decades’ rise in emissions, during which the earth’s temperature has risen perilously. Rather, they continue to struggle, even as they’re pummeled by the devastations of an ever more inhospitable climate system.  Emissions injustice collides with climate reality in complex ways, all the more so because we do not inhabit an astronaut’s borderless world, with its stylized planetary classes. The real world is divided among nations, every one of which is internally stratified between rich and poor. In this twice-divided world, the culture and politics of global inequality form a tangle of confusing and invidious dynamics—in itself a barrier to climate stabilization, which requires an international politics that is at least rational, if not visionary. Neither will be possible until inequality and injustice become central to climate politics. When the history of the climate reckoning is written, these current years will figure large in the tale. Indeed, the U.N. climate conference known as COP28, which will be held later this month in Dubai with Sultan Al Jaber of the United Arab Emirates—an oil executive from the global south—as its president, may well prove to be the pivot. A chill has come over the world’s elites in recent years as they gradually realize that today’s international governance system—with its parade of agonizingly compromised climate summits and its utter inability to establish a just and cooperative peace—may simply not be up to the challenge of climate stabilization.  Gordon Brown, the former British prime minister, is campaigning for a small international tax on oil and gas export revenue. William Ruto, the president of Kenya, is calling for a more ambitious package of reforms, including a tax on the international oil trade. (Unlike Brown, he is speaking for a group of countries, as per the common position negotiated at the Africa Climate Summit.) Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados and a key voice in the new finance debate, has similarly called for new corporate climate taxes, among much else, and takes care to stress that “not just the oil and gas companies” are properly targets of such taxes.  What would happen if we started taxing the obscenely wealthy and their massive emissions as well? We have a pretty good idea of how this class and their emissions are distributed: Per the World Inequality Lab, about 46 percent of global 10 percent emissions come from North America, about 16 percent from Europe, and about 12 percent from China. If you focus on the global one percent, the numbers get still more skewed—North America clocks in at 57 percent, Europe at 15 percent, and China at 6 percent. Clearly, the global one percent still tend to live in the global north, which is good to know, although we shouldn’t forget the rest of those in the global 10 percent, regardless of where they live.  The protesters are demanding that we tax the rich, and I could hardly agree more. The best approach would be multilayered: In practice, a proper climate funding framework would involve not just progressive emissions taxes but straight-up wealth taxes as well, and all sorts of innovative financial instruments, from financial transaction taxes to new kinds of international shadow currencies (“special drawing rights”), as well as profound energy subsidy reforms (according to the International Monetary Fund, fossil energy is now receiving about $7 trillion a year in direct and indirect subsidies), large-scale debt forgiveness for struggling countries, and an international fair-shares assessment process that fills the gaps and ensures that the whole package is balanced and just. But the centerpiece would ideally be global wealth taxes, which should be strongly linked to emissions. In his new book, A Brief History of Equality, French economist Thomas Piketty argues that we in “the egalitarian coalition” have “failed to produce a convincing alternative narrative” that shows how a “welfare state and progressive taxation do in fact constitute a system transformation of capitalism.” Constructing these alternative narratives, he argues, is a crucial gateway not just into a fairer future but also to global climate stabilization.  Piketty proposes instituting a progressive wealth tax, funding basic income, and supporting social welfare and environmental protection. “For starters, we can imagine, for example, a worldwide tax of 2 percent on fortunes that exceed 10 million euros, which would bring in considerable sums: around 1,000 billion euros each year, or 1 percent of global GDP,” he writes.  Obviously, such ideas won’t fit through the Overton window anytime soon. But many people have yet to grasp the severity of our predicament, and when they do (knock on wood), the window of imagined realism will expand. Piketty and many others are now anticipating such an expansion, and want to prepare for it with a global finance proposal that is explicitly scaled to both an emergency climate transition and the modern, planetary social democracy that, frankly, is a precondition for its success.  The alternative is clear enough: More ineffectual climate summits, episodic bursts of concerned rhetoric like the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, continued dithering by elites who are in fact responsible for many of the problems they say they want to solve. If we want to avoid such a fate, we’ll need a new kind of internationalism—call it emergency internationalism—that allows us to actually imagine a proper mobilization, at the necessary scale.  There is still time, but the clock is ticking.  Tom Athanasiou is the executive director of EcoEquity.","in 1990, humanity has spewed more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it had in all preceding history. a huge percentage of current and historical emissions comes from North America and Europe, with the united states responsible for twice as many emissions as any other country. the global rich is the story that’s crucial if we want to understand why our poor efforts at mitigation have been such unrelenting failures.",very negative,Technology,Technology,Technology,0

Data released this week showed exports to Asia jumped to $226.6 billion in the first nine months of the year, up by 10% from the same period of 2022. Exports to Africa surged by over 50% to $15.6 billion in January-September, compared with $10.1 billion one year ago. Russian imports from the two regions also increased, amounting to $140 billion in value terms in the case of Asia, up by 40% on 2022. Moscow also boosted purchases from Africa by 10% to $2.5 billion. Asian countries’ share of Russia’s overall foreign trade now accounts for about 70%, according to FCS data. In contrast, Russian trade with the EU has steadily declined. Exports to the bloc plunged from $216.7 billion in January-September 2022 to just $65.3 billion in the same period of this year. Imports from the EU were down by around 10% to $59.2 billion, data showed. “There has been a radical change in cargo turnover, the share and weight of countries in our trade. If previously EU countries accounted for 50% or more in pre-crisis, pre-Covid times, now it is up to 16%,” the acting head of the FCS, Ruslan Davydov, recently said. He added that trade with China and India was growing rapidly, while turnover with Latin American countries was also on the rise. Overall, Russian foreign trade amounted to $530.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023, decreasing by 16% from a year earlier. FCS data showed that exports declined by nearly 30%, to $317 billion, while imports increased by 18%, to $213.3 billion. The trade balance surplus amounted to $103.6 billion, according to the report.

Working together to expand access to – and lower the costs of – battery energy storage systems, for example, could ignite demand, stimulate innovation, and trigger a market transformation.  BANGALORE – The leaders’ declaration that emerged from the recent G20 summit in New Delhi highlighted the urgent need for collective action on climate change and sustainable finance. Central to the group’s Green Development Pact is the recognition that the energy transition must be cost-effective to accelerate progress. To reach this tipping point in affordability, we must remove the barriers – like insufficient and expensive energy storage – currently preventing the growth of renewables.   To be sure, there is a lot of ground to cover. According to the International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2022, the energy sector needs to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.    There is also the question of funding. As part of the declaration, G20 leaders reaffirmed the commitment made by developed countries to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance to support the developing world’s mitigation and adaptation efforts. In a speech before the summit, European Council President Charles Michel claimed that this goal would be met for the first time in 2023. While this represents a significant step forward, it falls far short of the $4.5 trillion in annual clean-energy investments required by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels.   A massive shift in our approach to climate finance is clearly necessary. Multilateral development banks and philanthropies should play a vital role in facilitating affordable financing and mitigating risk to encourage private-sector investment, as well as establishing low-cost funds to ease the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. The goal is not only to decrease dramatically the price of clean-energy technologies, but also to lower the costs for research and development, facilitate reaching mass-market scale, and develop financial linkages.   But progress on affordability requires a concerted effort from all quarters. By collaborating to drive down the costs of renewables, we can ignite demand, stimulate innovation, and trigger a market transformation that paves the way to a more sustainable and resilient future for us all.   Much depends on solving the problem of energy storage. Solar and wind power will almost certainly account for most renewable-electricity generation, owing to their affordability and widespread availability. But these sources are abundant only some of the time: countries around the equator receive about 12 hours of sunlight each day, while wind is inconsistent. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are emerging as a potential solution to this inherent variability – especially as they approach a critical cost-efficiency threshold.

  The Global Leadership Council, which was established by the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (of which I am chairman), has made BESS one of its signature initiatives. At the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, the council will launch the BESS Consortium, a multi-stakeholder partnership of leading development-finance institutions that will support the deployment of first-wave BESS projects across developing countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The aim is to mobilize five gigawatts of BESS by the end of 2024, secure more than $4 billion in grant, concessional, and commercial finance, and, by 2030, unlock 90 gigawatts of BESS to enable 400 gigawatts of renewable energy.   India, in particular, has huge potential for BESS, given its plan to increase renewable-energy capacity to 600 gigawatts (65% of total installed capacity) by 2032. To achieve this ambitious goal, distribution companies must be able to procure and accommodate large volumes of renewables in a sustainable manner. At the distribution end, BESS can provide grid balancing, ramping support, and other critical services to reduce the total cost of power procurement.   In New Delhi, a 40-megawatt-hours BESS project aims to build a scalable pathway for one gigawatt of storage by 2026, creating 10,000 jobs. The pilot project, when scaled up, could advance the technology and encourage more widespread renewable use. This would enhance the stability and dependability of the power grid, allowing for greater integration of clean-energy sources. Eventually, the project could cut carbon dioxide emissions and ensure a cost-effective and reliable supply of renewables.   These technologies have immense potential to promote economic diversification, strengthen energy security, and foster job opportunities. Collaborating to advance them and establish a global landscape where sustainable energy underpins prosperity is the focus of this week’s Energy Transition Dialogues in India.   The race to make renewables affordable offers an unparalleled opportunity to generate sustainable and inclusive growth while reducing CO2 emissions. But we can get there only if the private sector, governments, and civil society act together to lower the price of – and increase access to – clean tech.

	More movies potentially for next year’s starved 2024 theatrical release calendar: Focus Features has taken U.S. distribution rights to Oscar-winning All Quiet on the Western Front filmmaker Edward Berger’s papal thriller Conclave. The movie’s starry cast includes Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Carlos Diehz, Lucian Msamati, Brían F. O’Byrne, Merab Ninidze, Sergio Castellitto and Isabella Rossellini.  
	The Peter Straughan-penned script based on Robert Harris’ bestselling novel centers on the secret papal conclave, which is electing a new Pope. After the death of a beloved Pope, Cardinal Lawrence (Fiennes) is tasked with running this covert process inside the back corners of the Vatican. Lawrence quickly finds himself the center of a conspiracy, as the cardinals forge factions and rivalries to serve their own ambitions. As divisions and scandals start to boil over and the political machinations inside the Vatican intensify, Lawrence realizes the departed Pope had kept a secret from them that he must uncover before a new Pope is chosen.

But as new conflicts and the effects of climate change aggravate food insecurity, world leaders must make progress on four fronts.  LONDON – In London on November 20, the United Kingdom will host the Global Food Security Summit and launch a new strategy for international development. Despite pressing crises like the conflict in Gaza, we must stay focused on other parts of the global system, where ongoing crises of hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity demand an urgent response. Faced with immense suffering around the world, we need a UK government that is willing and able to offer solutions.   The organizations we lead – the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the International Rescue Committee – are resolutely committed to protecting vulnerable children and families wherever they are. In Gaza, the IRC has set out detailed proposals for a humanitarian ceasefire to save the lives of Palestinian civilians and increase urgent access to food, while CIFF is helping to lead the charge on issues like child wasting. We each have a clear stake in the success of the summit (which CIFF has helped organize) and the government’s new strategy for international development.   The global hunger crisis has become critical. Around 345 million people are facing acute levels of food insecurity this year – more than double the number in 2020 – and 45 million children under five suffer from acute malnutrition. Up to two million of those children die every year, and climate change and violent conflict are making the problem even worse.  To continue reading, register now.

This can be partly attributed to central banks’ decision to reject populist policy proposals in favor of a modern iteration of macroeconomic orthodoxy.  CAMBRIDGE – As finance ministers and central bankers convened in Marrakesh for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings on October 9-15, they faced an extraordinary confluence of economic and geopolitical calamities: wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, a wave of defaults among low- and lower-middle-income economies, a real-estate-driven slump in China, and a surge in long-term global interest rates – all against the backdrop of a slowing and fracturing world economy.   But what surprised veteran analysts the most was the expected calamity that hasn’t happened, at least not yet: an emerging-market debt crisis. Despite the significant challenges posed by soaring interest rates and the sharp appreciation of the US dollar, none of the large emerging markets – including Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam, South Africa, and even Turkey – appears to be in debt distress, according to both the IMF and interest-rate spreads.   This outcome has left economists puzzled. When did these serial defaulters become bastions of economic resilience? Could this be merely the proverbial calm before the storm?

                Like the surprising resilience of the US's ongoing seemingly-non-landing domestic economy, despite the US Fed's current non-trivial and quick rate-hiking cycle, the current even-more-surprising resilience of the EM countries may have been partly a result of the gradual rise of Bretton Woods III centered on the EM countries' commodities and energies relative to good old Bretton Wood II centered on the hegemon US dollar or the US government treasuries.-According to Zoltan Pozsar, owing to the current Ukraine War in Europe, Russian commodities (and energies) today are like what subprime CDOs were in 2008. Conversely, non-Russian commodities (and energies) are like U.S. Treasury securities back in 2008. One collapsing in price, and the other one surging.Commodities (and energies) are collateral, just like the US government treasuries, and collateral is money, thanks to the Eurodollar repo markets.Many EM countries' net-exporting commodities (and energies) are now more and more becoming good collaterals and hence monies in the global fund-raising shadow-banking markets.-And so, the commodity-and-energy exporting EM countries are currently enjoying a boom of their main exporting products in the global markets, which has enabled them to earn perhaps enough FX reserves to help repay a bigger part of their remaining foreign debts, despite the constant carry-trades-induced bidding-up of their US-dollar-denominated borrowing and refinancing rates as a result of the US Fed's ongoing higher-for-longer rate-hiking cycle.---Furthermore, FX-reserves-rich China, and her China-Infrastructure-Investment-Bank-financed Belt-and-Road Initiative, should also have helped some highly-indebted EM countries to have more easily avoided further defaulting of part of their remaining foreign debts. -In short, the US's Wolf Street, with her country's good old hegemon US dollar under BW II, and with the unabated help of her controlled IMF and the World Bank, will find it increasingly difficult to keep on easily harvesting, during the US Fed's coming renewed rate-hiking cycles, the unfortunate highly-indebted EM countries in the coming BW-III-emerging eras.---
             
                As shown by the first part of the following Youtube video made by Richard Werner, many of today's still-developing EM countries, unlike the handful of graduated or graduating EM countries since WWII which didn't abide by the Washington Consensus, have most probably been misguided and hence fooled by the misleading growth theories proposed by the DM-country economists in the past, who advocated the EM countries to keep borrowing from the foreign DM countries to help finance their domestic economic growth.As a result, ""this has caused a neo-colonial subjugation of developing countries, who are forced to export their commodities cheaply and so are not benefiting fairly from this trade.The solution ------ moving up the global value-added ladder ------ was prevented by the IMF/WB.""-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu4gn4n0itk&t=413s---This unfortunate status quo for those (highly-indebted) EM countries can more quickly be changed only if they (i) escape from the unabated dictate of the dying Washington Consensus,(ii) more eagerly participate in China's Belt-and-Road Initiative, and (iii) help build up the newly-emerging commodity-and-energy-based, global-terms-of-trade-changing-more-in-their-favor, and perhaps much more digitalized (satellite) global currency system known as BW III.---
             
                Is comparing Venezuela to other countries listed in this article appropriate? Venezuela faced both internal and external severe political pressures. It is also facing economic sanctions. It seems to me the collapse of its economy is more politically driven than by domestic economic policies. Also Venezuela is no more authoritarian than Vietnam which according the IMF is doing well.Regarding the question of the sustainability of the resilience of emerging economies, the position of the US dollar in international markets will be crucial. What is the relative importance of the dollar in the 1980s compared to now. Do emerging markets have alternative currency regimes that can prolong their resilience? Can BRICS provide a second best alternative for these countries?

On one side of the ditch were 300,000 Palestinians, 200,000 of them refugees expelled from the surrounding area; on the other were a handful of new Israeli settlements. The Palestinian fighters attempted to enter the kibbutz of Nahal Oz, killing Roi Rotberg, a security officer. They took his body back with them to Gaza, but returned it after the UN intervened. Moshe Dayan, then Israel’s chief of the general staff, happened to be in the settlement for a wedding and asked to give the eulogy at Rotberg’s funeral the following evening. Speaking of the men who killed Rotberg he asked: ‘Why should we complain of their hatred for us? Eight years they sat in the refugee camps of Gaza, and saw in front of their eyes how we turned the lands and the villages in which they and their forefathers once dwelled into our homeland.’ It was a recognition of what Palestinians had lost that contemporary Israeli politicians can no longer afford to express. But Dayan wasn’t advocating the right of return: he ended his speech by arguing that Israelis had to prepare themselves for a permanent and bitter war, which would have a major role for what Israel called ‘frontier settlements’. Over the years, the ploughed ditch turned into a complex system of fortifications – a 300-metre buffer zone, where more than two hundred Palestinian demonstrators were shot and killed in 2018-19 and thousands more injured, several layers of razor-wire fences, concrete walls extending underground, remote-control machine guns – and surveillance equipment including watchtowers, CCTV, radar sensors and spy balloons. Beyond this are a series of military bases, some of them near or inside the civilian settlements that form what’s known as the Gaza Envelope. On 7 October, in a co-ordinated attack, Hamas struck at all the elements of this interlinked system. Nahal Oz, the closest settlement to the fence, was one of the attack’s focal points. The term ‘Nahal’ refers to the military unit that established the frontier settlements. Nahal settlements started life as military outposts and were supposed to turn into civilian villages, mostly of the kibbutz type. But the transformation is never complete, and some residents are expected to double as defenders when the time comes. ‘Absentee land’ was the tabula rasa on which Israeli planners drafted the blueprint of the Zionist settler project after the expulsions of 1948. Its chief architect was Arieh Sharon, a graduate of the Bauhaus, who studied under Walter Gropius and Hannes Meyer before moving to Palestine in 1931, where he built housing estates, workers’ co-operatives, hospitals and cinemas. When the state of Israel was established, David Ben-Gurion made him head of the Government Planning Department. In The Object of Zionism (2018) the architectural historian Zvi Efrat explained that, though Sharon’s master plan was based on the latest principles of modernist design, it had several other aims: to provide homes for the waves of immigrants who had arrived after the Second World War, to move Jewish populations from the centre to the periphery, to secure the frontier and to occupy territory in order to make the return of refugees more difficult. In the 1950s and 1960s, Sharon’s master plan and its successors led to the building in the ‘frontier zones’, then defined as roughly 40 per cent of the country, of regional hubs or ‘development towns’ which served a constellation of agrarian settlements. These development towns were meant to house Jewish immigrants from North Africa – the Arab Jews – who would be proletarianised into factory workers. The agrarian settlements of the kibbutz and moshav type were meant for the pioneering members of the labour movement, mainly Eastern Europeans. The land belonging to the Palestinian villages of Dayr Sunayd, Simsim, Najd, Huj, Al Huhrraqa, Al Zurai’y, Abu Sitta, Wuhaidat, and to the Tarabin and Hanajre Bedouin tribes, was built over by the development towns Sderot and Ofakim and the kibbutzim of Be’eri, Re’im, Mefalsim, Kissufim and Erez. All of these settlements were targeted on 7 October. Following Israel’s occupation in 1967, the government established settlements between the main Palestinian population centres in Gaza itself. The largest was Gush Katif, near Rafah on the Egyptian border; in total, Israeli colonies covered 20 per cent of Gaza’s territory. In the early 1980s the area in and around Gaza also absorbed many Israeli settlers evacuated from Sinai after the peace accord with Egypt. The first fence around the territory was built between 1994 and 1996 – a time seen as the height of the ‘peace process’. Gaza was now being isolated from the rest of the world. When, in response to Palestinian resistance, Israel’s Gaza colonies were dismantled in 2005, some of the evacuees chose to relocate to settlements close to Gaza’s borders. A second, more advanced fencing system was completed shortly after. In 2007, a year after Hamas took power in Gaza, Israel began its full-scale siege, controlling and limiting incoming flows of life-sustaining provisions such as food, medicine, electricity and petrol. The Israeli army calibrates the privation to a level that brings life in Gaza to an almost complete standstill. Together with a series of bombing campaigns, which according to the UN resulted in 3500 Palestinian deaths between 2008 and September this year, the siege has brought humanitarian disaster on an unprecedented scale: civil institutions, hospitals, water and hygiene systems are barely able to function, with electricity available for only around half the day. Almost half of Gaza’s population is unemployed and more than 80 per cent rely on aid to meet basic needs. The Israeli government offers generous tax breaks (a 20 per cent reduction in income tax, for example) to residents of the settlements around Gaza, many of which are strung along a road a few kilometres from the fence line and running parallel to it. The Gaza Envelope contains 58 settlements within 10 km of the border, with 70,000 inhabitants. In the seventeen years since Hamas took power, despite sporadic Palestinian rocket and mortar fire, as well as Israeli bombardment of the territory a few miles away, the number of settlers has kept growing. Rising property prices in the Tel Aviv area, and the region’s open hills (real estate agents call it the ‘Tuscany of the Northern Negev’), have led to an influx of middle-class settlers. Conditions on the other side of the fence have deteriorated in inverse proportion to the region’s growing prosperity. The settlements are a central part of the system of enclosure imposed on Gaza, but their inhabitants tend to differ from the religious settlers of the West Bank. Demonstrating the partial blindness of the Israeli left, some settlers in the Negev are involved in the peace movement. On 7 October, Hamas fighters broke through the interlinked elements of the siege network. Snipers shot at the cameras that overlook the no-go zone. They dropped grenades on the communication towers. Barrages of rockets saturated the radar space. Rather than tunnelling under the fences, the fighters approached on the ground. The Israeli observers either failed to see them, or couldn’t quickly communicate what they saw. The fighters blew or cut open a few dozen holes in the fence. Palestinian bulldozers widened the breaches. Some Hamas fighters used paragliders to cross the border. More than a thousand stormed the military bases. The Israeli army, blinded and muted, was left without a clear picture of the battlefield and detachments took hours to arrive. Unbelievable images appeared online. Palestinian teenagers followed the fighters on bikes or horses into land they may have heard about from their grandparents but was now transformed beyond recognition. After the bases came the settlements, and the massacres that no previous violence can justify. Families were burned or shot in their homes. In total, the fighters killed about 1300 civilians and soldiers. Two hundred people were captured and taken to Gaza. Israel has spent decades blurring the line between the civilian and military functions of the settlements, but now the line has been blurred in ways never intended by the Israeli government. The civilian inhabitants co-opted into becoming part of the living wall of the Gaza Envelope got the worst of both worlds. They couldn’t defend themselves like soldiers, and they weren’t protected like civilians. The images of the devastated settlements provided the Israeli army with a free pass from the international community, and lifted whatever restraint may have held it back in previous rounds. Israeli politicians called for revenge in explicit, annihilationist language. Commentators said Gaza should be ‘wiped off the face of the Earth’, and ‘It’s time for Nakba 2.’ Revital Gottlieb, a Likud member of the Knesset, tweeted: ‘Bring down buildings!! Bomb without distinction!! Stop with this impotence. You have ability. There is worldwide legitimacy! Flatten Gaza. Without mercy!’ However the conflict ends, with or without Hamas in power (and I bet on the former), Israel won’t be able to avoid negotiating over the exchange of prisoners. For Hamas, the starting point will be the six thousand Palestinians currently in Israeli prisons, many of them held in administrative detention without trial. The capture of Israelis has had a central place in the Palestinian armed struggle throughout the 75 years of conflict. By obtaining hostages the PLO and other groups aimed to force Israel into an implicit recognition of Palestinian nationhood. The Israeli position in the 1960s was to deny that there was such a thing as a Palestinian people, which meant that it was logically impossible to recognise the PLO as their legitimate representative. The denial also meant that there was no need to recognise Palestinian fighters as legitimate combatants under international law, and therefore no need to grant them POW status in line with the Geneva Conventions. Captured Palestinians were held in a legal limbo, much like the ‘unlawful combatants’ of the post-9/11 era. In July 1968 the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) hijacked an El-Al flight and landed it in Algeria, inaugurating a series of hijackings whose explicit aim was the release of Palestinian prisoners. The Algeria incident led to 22 Israeli hostages being exchanged for sixteen Palestinian prisoners, though the Israeli government denied that there had been a deal at all. Sixteen for 22: such an exchange rate would not hold for long. In September 1982, after Israel’s invasion of Lebanon, Ahmed Jibril’s PFLP-General Command captured three IDF soldiers; three years later, in what was known as the Jibril agreement, Israel and the PFLP-GC finally reached a prisoner-swap deal: three soldiers for 1150 Palestinian prisoners. In the 2011 deal to release Gilad Shalit, captured by Hamas in 2006, the exchange rate was even more favourable to the Palestinians: 1027 prisoners for a single Israeli soldier. In anticipation of being forced to make many more such deals, Israel began arbitrarily to arrest more Palestinians, including minors, to increase its assets for future exchange. It also kept the bodies of Palestinian fighters, to be returned as part of any exchange. All of this reinforces the perception that the life of one of the colonisers is worth a thousand times more than the lives of the colonised. This calculation inevitably brings to mind the history of human trading. But here the exchange rate is mobilised by the Palestinian resistance to invert the deep structural colonial asymmetry. Different states deal with the capture of their soldiers and citizens in different ways. The Europeans and Japanese usually engage in secret prisoner exchanges or negotiate ransoms. The US and UK claim in public that they don’t negotiate or comply with captors’ demands, and although they haven’t always strictly adhered to this, they have favoured inaction and silence when a rescue operation has seemed impossible. This is seen as the ‘lesser evil’ and is part of what military game theorists call the ‘repeated game’: every action is evaluated in relation to its possible long-term consequences, with the benefits of securing a prisoner’s release weighed against the chance that the exchange will result in more soldiers or civilians being captured in future. When any Israeli is captured, their family, friends and supporters take to the streets to campaign for their release. Most often, the government acquiesces and makes a deal. The Israeli army usually advises the government against exchange deals, pointing to the security risk posed by released captives, especially senior commanders, and to the likelihood that it will encourage more hostage-taking by Palestinian fighters. Yahya Sinwar, who is now the leader of Hamas, was released in the Shalit deal. A significant civil campaign against such exchanges was led by the religious settler movement Gush Emunim, which saw them as a manifestation of the fragility of Israel’s ‘secular-liberal’ society. In 1986, in the wake of the Jibril deal, the Israeli army issued the controversial Hannibal Directive, a secret operational order designed to be invoked on the capture of an Israeli soldier by an irregular armed force. The military has denied this interpretation, but it was understood by Israeli soldiers as a licence to kill a comrade before they were taken prisoner. In 1999, Shaul Mofaz, the then chief of the general staff, explained the policy: ‘With all the pain that saying this entails, an abducted soldier, in contrast to a soldier who has been killed, is a national problem.’ Although the military claimed that the directive’s name was randomly selected by a computer program, it is an apt one. The Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca killed himself in 181 bc in order not to fall into Roman hands. The Romans had shown similar resolve thirty years earlier: when Hannibal tried to secure a ransom for the soldiers he had captured in his victory at Cannae, the Senate, after a heated debate, refused and the prisoners were executed. On 1 August 2014, during the offensive on Gaza known as Operation Protective Edge, Palestinian fighters captured an IDF soldier near Rafah, and the Hannibal Directive came into effect. The air force bombed the tunnel system into which the soldier had been taken and 135 Palestinian civilians, including entire families, were killed in the bombardment. The army has since cancelled the directive. But with the current indiscriminate bombing of Gaza, the government seems not only to be bringing unprecedented destruction on the people of Gaza but to be returning to the principle of preferring dead captives to a deal. Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s finance minister, has called for Hamas to be hit ‘mercilessly, without taking into serious consideration the matter of the captives’. Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, has said that the hostages ‘would not prevent us from doing what we need to do’. But in this war the fate of the civilians in Gaza and the captured Israelis is closely entangled, as is that of both peoples. Send Letters To:

University of the Witwatersrand provides support as a hosting partner of The Conversation AFRICA. View all partners Death rates in South Africa have declined slightly during the past few years. But the country faces a steady rise in both death and disability caused by increases in non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cancer. According to the NCD Alliance, a civil society network, non-communicable diseases cause 71% of deaths globally. Of these deaths 85% occur in low and middle income countries.  In South Africa, according to Statistics South Africa, there was an increase of 58% in deaths from non-communicable diseases from 1997 to 2018. Diabetes is the second leading cause of death in South Africa after tuberculosis.  Diabetes affects 12% of the adult population, wreaking massive damage to individuals’ health and livelihoods, and to the national fiscus. The direct cost of diabetes to South Africa’s health system is R2.7 billion (US$150 million) – and that is only for those patients who are diagnosed. It does not factor in the indirect costs of loss of jobs and income.  If all cases were diagnosed and treated, PRICELESS SA, a research unit based at the School of Public Health at the University of the Witwatersrand, estimates this would cost R21.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) a year, rising to R35 billion (US$1.9 billion) in real terms by 2030. Finance minister Enoch Godongwana will table the medium-term budget policy statement this week. Based on our research and the experience elsewhere in the world, we believe Godongwana has an opportunity to improve both South Africa’s fiscal health and its public health in one swift, effective action: by increasing the Health Promotion Levy, better known as the “sugar tax” on beverages. Most South Africans with diabetes are either diagnosed very late, by which time they are much sicker, or are not diagnosed at all. The SA Demographic Health Survey data from 2016,  the most recent study, found that 67% of all men and women were “pre-diabetic” and suggested that a “large portion” of South Africans remained undiagnosed, and therefore untreated. Untreated or badly controlled diabetes can result in amputations, kidney failure and blindness. Many of these same individuals also have high blood pressure and end up with stroke as a result of brain haemorrhage.  Obesity is known to be linked to diabetes – and rates of obesity and overweight people, too, are increasing relentlessly. Current rates of obesity in South Africa are 11% among men (with another 20.3% overweight), and 41% among women (with another 26.6% overweight). At this rate it is expected that 50% of South African women will be obese by 2030.   Both obesity and diabetes are known to be triggered by over-consumption of sugar. Liquid sugar is known to be particularly harmful and has no nutritional value. This is why the public health recommends at least a 20% tax on sugary beverages.  The Health Promotion Levy should also include 100% fruit juices in the list of products subject to the tax. In 2018, in an attempt to address South Africa’s obesity, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases, National Treasury imposed a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, known as the Health Promotion Levy. It equates to 2.1 cents per gram of sugar above a 4 gram threshold per 100 millilitres – which amounts to a levy of approximately 11% on the price. As of June 2022, the sugar tax alone had raised more than R10 billion (US$750 million) in revenues that went directly to the treasury. Only R24 million (US$1.3 million) in 2019/2020 and R14 million (US$0.7 million) in 2020/2021 was allocated to expenditure on “health promotion”.  But the South African sugar industry fought the sugar tax from the outset. The tax started out at a lower rate than originally planned: it was designed to be 20% in line with World Health Organization recommendations, but was slashed to 11% because of sugar industry pressure during a prolonged public consultation period. The already ailing industry alleged it would cause further job losses.  In reality, other global sugar market realities are the cause of declines in local sugar production and jobs. For example distorted global prices are below South Africa’s cost of production. This predated the introduction of the sugar tax.  The South African government has not increased the sugar levy from its initial 11% in the five years since it started. It has put previously planned increases on hold.  In the February 2023 budget speech the minister again imposed a two-year moratorium on the Health Promotion Levy, not even allowing for an inflation-related increase. In real terms, the sugar tax has effectively been reduced. The South African Sugarcane Growers’ Association has expressed concern at the prospect of an increase in the levy, fearing negative impacts on the sugar industry. Yet research  from PRICELESS, analysing data from the South African Quarterly Labour Force Survey from January 2008 to June 2019, shows that the sugar levy has had little effect on sugar-industry employment. 
Even at its current weaker-than-ideal rate, the tax has reduced consumers’ consumption of sugary beverages by about 2g per capita per day, separate research led by PRICELESS SA scientists shows.  To reverse South Africa’s fatal diabetes trend and pour additional, much-needed billions into public funds, the government should increase the rate of the Health Promotion Levy to the 20% endorsed by the WHO.  Early detection and treatment is key to reducing the disabling effects of diabetes and the cost to the state. Therefore better diagnosis in the public health system should be prioritised – and funded from Health Promotion Levy revenues.   The fact that the Health Promotion Levy has already yielded more than R10 billion to the treasury is testament to its revenue potential. The win-win consequences of raising the levy seem indisputable.","professor and programme director, SA MRC Centre for health Economics and Decision Science - PRICELESS SA (Priority Cost Effective Lessons in Systems Strengthening South Africa), university of the Witwatersrand Susan Goldstein receives funding from the Bloomberg Foundation. she does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article.",very negative,Politics,Politics,Technology,0

South Africa is hosting a US-sub-Saharan Africa trade forum to discuss the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) — a program that provides eligible countries in the region with tarrif-free access to US markets.  Ministers from about 40 sub-Saharan African countries benefiting from the AGOA are meeting with US envoys for three days in Johannesburg. The US initiative — which was passed in 2000 with the aim of deepening trade ties with Sub-Saharan Africa and helping African nations develop their economies — is set to expire at the end of September 2025. Countries can lose and regain eligibility based on criteria including adherence to democracy, protection of human rights, and a market-based economy. The United States earlier this week announced plans to expel Uganda, Gabon, Niger and the Central African Republic (CAR) from January 2024 over concerns about coups, democracy and human rights. One of the main topics likely to be in focus at the forum is whether or not the AGOA should be extended beyond its September 2025 expiration date — and if so, for how long.  ""We would like an extension of AGOA for 10 years,"" AU trade and industry commissioner Albert Muchanga told DW. ""If the offer is 20 years, l think, we as Africa should be ready to accept it."" South Africa's trade minister, Ebrahim Patel, informed delegates that the continent is prepared to double its exports if the extension of this pact is granted beyond 2025. He said that there is a need for Africa to be more strategic in its negotiations with the US. ""Africa is finding its role in the world,"" Patel said. ""We will develop a common view that we will present as separate delegations when we engage the United States.""

South Africa’s big miss is no small matter for the climate change movement because, as Reuters pointed out, it is “the world’s 11th biggest greenhouse gas emitter and has one of the world’s highest per capita emissions.” The original plan called for South Africa to shut down six of its coal-fired power plants by 2030 and two more by 2034. The officials who spoke to Reuters said those goals are now considered “unrealistic,” although the government might set a “new decommissioning target for 2035.” The South African environmental ministry issued a statement saying it was “too early” to conclude the Paris Agreement targets for 2030 cannot be met. South Africa is already in the midst of a major energy crisis, even with all those coal plants puffing away. The World Bank announced in mid-October that talks were underway for a billion-dollar loan to help South Africa recover from rolling blackouts that have put a major crimp on economic growth. The World Bank already loaned South Africa’s state utility company, Eskom, $497 million in 2022 to decommission one of its coal power plants. The plant, an aging facility located near the city of Komati east of Johannesburg, was shuttered last October, but the “transition to cleaner energy” was a disaster. The South African government did not consult with the 1,600 local workers employed by the Komati plant or help them find new jobs. Energy officials fretted the loss of the plant would jeopardize the power grid, sowing panic, confusion, and vain hopes the Komati plant might reopen. Eskom estimates that roughly 80 percent of South Africa’s power comes from its coal-fired plants, which are becoming unreliable due to mismanagement and corruption. Instead of “transitioning” to green energy, South Africa is leaning on its coal plants harder than ever as it experiences the worst blackouts in its history. The South African government has said it would need about $80 billion to finance a proper transition to green energy, a sum that seems very unlikely to be forthcoming. The United Nations published a report on Wednesday that said governments around the world planned to exceed the Paris Agreement’s limits on fossil fuels by over 110 percent by 2030. Meeting the Paris Agreement limits would require the almost total worldwide shutdown of coal power plants by 2040 – but the heaviest coal users, China and India, are still increasing their coal-fired generator capacity.","south africa is already in the midst of a major energy crisis, even with all those coal plants puffing away. the world bank already loaned south africa’s state utility company $497 million in 2022 to decommission one of its coal power plants. the plant was shuttered last October, but the “transition to cleaner energy” was a disaster.",very negative,Politics,Finance,Technology,0
uk government plans radical shake foreign aid climate change disasters,BBC News,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67456174,new 150m fund help poorer countries prepare humanitarian disasters access money faster,uk government spend millions pounds helping countries prepare future humanitarian disasters radical shake development policy bbc learned new 150m fund w 3767 chars,2023-11-18T02:34:35Z,"The UK government is to spend millions of pounds helping countries prepare for future humanitarian disasters in a radical shake-up of its development policy, the BBC has learned.   A new £150m fund will help poorer countries get access to money faster in emergencies and reduce the impact of future climate crises.   The change is expected to be part of a new White Paper designed to make Britain's foreign aid spending go further while also finding new sources of international finance. Ministers hope the 140-page policy document - published on Monday - can help restore Britain's reputation as a development superpower after years of aid cuts.   It is understood the paper has been endorsed by world leaders, global philanthropists and international finance chiefs.   Ministers are also hoping to win cross-party support in Parliament so the seven-year plans survive beyond the next election regardless of the outcome.  The central idea of the White Paper is that conflict, climate and Covid have changed and blighted the world so much that countries must think differently about development.   It will argue that instead of wealthier states just handing out money, they should form new partnerships with developing countries - based on mutual respect - within an international system that finances new ways of tackling extreme poverty.   The government's plans will not involve spending more taxpayers' money - the UK will continue to allocate 0.5% of its national income on foreign aid each year, which in 2022 was about £12bn.   But the document will set out how to make the cash go further. The government currently plans to spend about £1bn on humanitarian aid in 2024. The new ""resilience and adaption fund"" will automatically take 15% of that money, which will be used to help countries prepare for future humanitarian and climate disasters.   So a drought-stricken country would not just get emergency food and water in the short term, but also investment in wells and reservoirs to help reduce the impact and cost of future emergencies.   There are also plans for special insurance schemes and pre-agreed contingency funds to ensure countries can get access to humanitarian cash the moment disaster strikes, instead of having to wait for donor countries to raise the money which can take some time.  Developing countries may also automatically be able to stop paying back international debts in times of crisis.   The White Paper is expected to set out plans to unlock more private finance to help the world meet the United Nations sustainable development goals, known as SDGs.   These plans - to cut poverty, hunger and inequality and boost education, health and climate action - were agreed in 2015. But the targets are considered widely off track and unlikely to be met by their 2030 end date.   The idea is to use the balance sheets of international financial institutions, such as the World Bank and the IMF, to guarantee greater investment in development from private capital such as pension funds.   The government also plans to reduce the costs incurred by workers in richer countries when they send money to families back home in developing countries.  The global value of so-called ""remittances"" is huge, about £520bn each year, which is three times as much as all overseas development assistance given by governments.   But up to 35% of the value of ""remittances"" can be lost in currency and transaction fees, which could be reduced through sharing more technology and regulatory expertise.   The government's development and Africa minister, Andrew Mitchell, said Monday's White Paper should be seen as a restatement of the value of aid and a glimmer of hope in dark times.   ""Our world is troubled and fragmented,"" he said. ""Do we give up on it? Or do we act?  ""The White Paper is our plan to make the world a better and safer place with solutions that are in the UK's gift to deliver. We have the will and the way to make a difference.""   Earthquake aid appeal raises more than £100m Four ways climate change affects extreme weather",a new £150m fund will help poorer countries get access to money faster in emergencies. the change is expected to be part of a new white paper designed to restore Britain's reputation as a development superpower after years of aid cuts. ministers hope the 140-page document can help restore Britain's reputation as a development superpower.,positive,Technology,Technology,Technology,3

Barry Ritholtz:  00:00:06  This week on the podcast, I have yet another extra special guest, Linda Gibson, CEO of PG imm Quantitative Solutions. She has a really fascinating background, very eclectic, a combination of math and law. She has run a number of firms and a number of divisions at large firms and traced a career arc that’s just very unusual compared to the typical person in finance. Eventually leading her to a point where she’s managing quants, running about a hundred billion dollars in assets. Really a fascinating background, and it just goes to show you how broad and flexible the world of finance is, that there are so many different ways you can find yourself in a senior management position in, in this industry. If, if you had to guess someone would run through this path, you would, you would never assume, well, you’re gonna come outta law school and eventually you’re gonna be general counsel. Barry Ritholtz: 00:01:15 How does that lead to running a group of quants? But that was Linda’s career path. There are a few people in the world who are more knowledgeable about the management of asset managers and what it’s like to actually run a global organization and interact with lots of aspects of the business of finance, whether that’s acquisitions or compliance, or dealing with all the legalities of multi-jurisdictional regulations. She, she really has been the person who’s lived this and, and walk the walk. And I found this conversation to be quite fascinating. And I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Linda Gibson, CEO of PGIM, quantitative Solutions. So let’s get into your background, which is really kind of interesting. You, you get a, a BS in Mathematics and a JD from Boston University Math and Law. Yep. Not the usual combination. Linda Gibson: 00:02:16 Not, not at all, Barry. It is something, math has always come easy to me since a child. So I was a math major pretty much because it was an easy a for me, Barry Ritholtz: 00:02:27 [Speaker Changed] Math is truth. Linda Gibson: 00:02:29 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely, it is. I loved the fact that my grades weren’t subject to the subjectivity of my professors and that there was always a right and wrong answer. And the one that, Barry Ritholtz: 00:02:41 [Speaker Changed] Well, that’s, that’s until you get to applied Mathematics where it all goes off the rails, Linda Gibson:  00:02:44 [Speaker Changed] Which if you notice, that is where I stopped. I didn’t get an advanced degree in math. Barry Ritholtz: 00:02:50 [Speaker Changed] But you do get the, the jd and, and you said you weren’t a math nerd. You, you were not looking for a job in finance. What happened? Linda Gibson:  00:02:59 [Speaker Changed] I was not, I was waitressing one summer, my final summer after my senior year and a friend called and said, I just interviewed with the financial services company. I’m not interested in the job, but you might wanna reach out. And I literally reached out. It was Mass Financial Services. I reached out, I got the interview and I got the job. And I started the next week. Didn’t really think about going into financial services. I thought it was going to be honestly a math teacher. I was thinking about teaching in, in boarding school. So Barry Ritholtz: 00:03:29 [Speaker Changed] Wait, so you go to MFS, is that between college and law school? And, and you discover, Hey, this finance stuff is kind of interesting. What then led you to go to law school instead of business school? Linda Gibson: 00:03:46 [Speaker Changed] I worked with a bunch of lawyers. So I worked at the third party administrator distribution arm of mutual fund family at Mass Financial. So it’s called the banking services group. It was back when banks couldn’t offer and distribute mutual funds. So we had clients like Chase and Citibank and JP Morgan and all of those. And so I worked with a bunch of lawyers and our company was going through transition at the time, and I thought I always wanted, I knew I wanted to get an advanced degree. My father is still a practicing lawyer at 85, and my grandfather was a Lawyer. Barry Ritholtz: So you come from a long family of of attorneys. Linda Gibson: 00:04:21 [Speaker Changed] I do. But my father advised me not to go into law. He always wanted to be a stockbroker, even though he is entrust in estates. Yes. So he was never really interested in pushing me to go into the law. And even though he worked for his father’s law practice with the name on the door, literally. Right. That was not an option for me. Barry Ritholtz: 00:04:41 [Speaker Changed] That, that’s so amusing. ’cause I immediately imagined getting pushback from the family. Hey, everybody here is a lawyer. We, our name is on the door. You’re you’re turning your back on the family business. Linda Gibson: 00:04:55 [Speaker Changed] Nope. They were at a point where they anti-nepotism or nepotism was an issue. And they said, Nope, you will not be coming to work for this firm. So don’t even think about it. Huh. So I was literally sitting on the roof deck one night and I was balancing law business school, which one made more sense for me and didn’t really know that much about either, but I was very logical by nature. And I was working with a bunch of lawyers at the time. And I also love the fact that, well, it took one more a year to get through school, three years versus two. But when you come out, you are something, you’re a lawyer, you have something. And so off I went to law school. Barry Ritholtz: 00:05:30 [Speaker Changed] I I thought you were gonna say indebted, but it it really that too. It, it really doesn’t matter when you, when you come outta business school, you’re an MBA, when you come outta law school, assuming you pass the bar, you’re JD and you’re to practice. How soon after law school did you realize I don’t wanna practice law? Linda Gibson: 00:05:50 [Speaker Changed] Pretty soon. I, I went into second year, third year law School. It was pretty much the third year of law school. I was an immersive mock trial program where you spend the whole year and you work for the DA’s office and the prosecutor’s office. Right. I thought I wanted to be a trial lawyer. Lawyer. LA Law was what it was all about. Barry Ritholtz: 00:06:08 [Speaker Changed] Everybody did it. Exactly, exactly. Linda Gibson: 00:06:09 [Speaker Changed] It was so cool. And so I thought that’s what I wanted to do. I I got into it. I wanted every single one of my cases to settle. I did not like law, especially trial work at all. And I was walking on the street and I ran into somebody I had worked with at this banking services group of MFS, which had spun off and become Signature Financial Group. And the woman said to me, you might wanna come back and work for us. Have you thought about it? And I said, absolutely. I’m in. What do I need to do? And I started working for them part-time during my third year of law school, and then worked for them 10 years after. Barry Ritholtz: 00:06:44 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That, that’s interesting. When, when did the Harvard Advance Management program come along? Linda Gibson: 00:06:50 [Speaker Changed] That came along much later. So I spent the first decade of my career as a mutual fund attorney, which was really Barry Ritholtz: 00:06:59 [Speaker Changed] In-house for, not for a law firm, but for a, a mutual fund related company. Linda Gibson: 00:07:05 [Speaker Changed] Right. This was the Signature Financial group. And that was a great opportunity to learn, frankly, because not only was I writing, offering documents, I was reading, I mean, how many people do you know that have read the 40 Act and read the various use its directives, which is the, basically the UK equivalent to the 40 Act. Barry Ritholtz:  00:07:23 [Speaker Changed] I know a lot of people keeping on the nightstand in case they get a little, little — If they have getting sleep, yeah. Puts ’em right out. Linda Gibson: 00:07:30 [Speaker Changed] Right. So that was just a really good foundation for me. I, I also sat, as I said, we were the third party distributor for all of these major companies. So I was on 12 different boards, not on them, but I was the officer, so I was taking minutes. So I was learning just a ton about the mutual fund industry and working with these big global companies. But then this company, I’m getting off topic of the advanced management degree, but this company launched a new investment fund structure called Global Hub and Spoke or Master Feeder, you might have heard of it. Yep. And I was chosen by the CEO to go travel globally with him to not only get big firms, the likes of HSBC, Julius Bayer, those types to adopt this fund structure, but also to get regulatory approval. So I was traveling all around the globe. This is, I was in my twenties and pregnancy. That Barry Ritholtz:  00:08:19 [Speaker Changed] Has to be a lot of fun on the company dime. Linda Gibson: 00:08:21 [Speaker Changed] Was very, very fun. We were front of the bus, front of the bus, hotels, everything. Yeah. Well, we actually had a flat in London bet. So I was going to Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, the UK trying to get regulatory approval of this mutual fund structure. So it was really, really a great foundation for me. And I, I did that for about 10 years. And this is where I, I moved over to UAM at the time, which is the first multi boutique investment business. And I moved over there into their third party mutual fund business as general counsel. 00:08:56 [Speaker Changed] So that, that’s the real interesting question is why General counsel in-House when given your background, you could have gone to any of the big firms, Skadden elsewhere. It is. And, and made a ton of money working as an attorney working for these big fund companies. 00:09:14 [Speaker Changed] It’s ironic that you, you said that, you said Skadden because, 00:09:18 [Speaker Changed] Not ironic at all. When 00:09:19 [Speaker Changed] I was thinking about going to Old Mutual, I was offered a job at Skadden that same day for the same amount of money. And I knew UAM was potentially going to be acquired, and I knew it was a riskier business, but I thought I can go work for a law firm and then eventually become a general counsel, or I can just skip the law firm step, especially working at a firm like Skadden and go directly to the general counsel job, which I thought was much more interesting to me. So even though Skadden had such a big name, I decided to go to UAM. And it’s, 00:09:54 [Speaker Changed] It’s a really challenging life work balance at my, my friends who all went to big firms. Like you hear stories and, and they, all they do is wine. Why don’t you quit? I can’t leave. I’m making so much money. Right? But you’re miserable. I’m just gonna do this for another five years. I, I’ve heard every 10, 20 years it keeps going. So you skip that, went in house, never looked back, 00:10:17 [Speaker Changed] Never looked back. And the firm got acquired. Pretty much a year later, I was told to shut down my division or my business unit, which I did. And more interestingly, given my UITs background and the fact that I had traveled globally, this was a South African based firm. So Old Mutual, but it was listed in London. So the head office was in London. They were very interested in my global experience and my regulatory experience. So they said, Hey, you wanna become general counsel of the holding company? Why wouldn’t you? Right? So I then put all of my 40 ACT work aside, and that’s when I really learned the art of negotiation. They had 44 affiliates at the time. We had to convert them from revenue share to profit sharing. We had to put equity in the hands of the founders and their management teams. We were doing m and a work, we were disposing of firms that weren’t strategic. We were acquiring firms. So I ended up negotiating with so many CEOs, CIOs, and founders that was really eye-opening when people have self-interest and it infects their wallets. They are very interesting people. So I had to pivot and just, that’s a 00:11:23 [Speaker Changed] Very polite phrase. Interesting people. Were you New York based, London based, or nylon back and forth? 00:11:30 [Speaker Changed] I was Boston based. We were Boston based, but we had, our parent company was in London, and then the ultimate Insurance company was in South Africa. So I was in London quarterly. And then we had affiliates. We had 44 affiliates, and they were all over the us but they were also in the UK and Tokyo at the time. 00:11:50 [Speaker Changed] Oh, so you were really on a plane a lot global. Yeah, I think, I think the flight from Vancouver to Tokyo is faster than the flight from New York to South Africa. That’s a, that’s a bear of a flight, isn’t it? It 00:12:02 [Speaker Changed] Is. But South Africa is really amazing. And it was interesting going into Cape Town and looking around. The brand old Mutual was like Coca-Cola here. Oh, really? It was on every building everywhere. Huh? It was really interesting. They had offices in Cape Town and Joe Burke. I preferred Cape Town, of course. But, 00:12:19 [Speaker Changed] So the obvious question, given this background in, in law and working on mutual funds and eventually becoming general counsel, how does this prep you for the role you have today? Essentially herding cats and managing a whole bunch of quants. 00:12:38 [Speaker Changed] Again, the learning and negotiation skills really helped a a lot in, in dealing with managing investment professionals as well as managing quants. As you know, quants have extremely high IQs. I mean, our firm PGM Quant, we have 29 PhDs. Our CIO is literally an ex rocket scientist who used to work at nasa. Right. And then we have an advisor to the Chancellor of the Ex Checker in the UK as ACIO. So these are very, very smart people. Managing them. You, you definitely have to adapt your style a bit. So you have to learn how to deal with smart people as well as introverts. We have a lot of introverts at our firm. They sometimes have trouble talking to clients. Sometimes they have trouble talking to me. So I need to adjust my management style. But what I learned really early in my career is that it’s not about iq, it’s about, well, it is about iq. 00:13:30 We need very smart people. But EQ is equally important. So I, what I have to do for them is I have to lead them, direct them, manage them, and then sort of push them, but then just leave them alone. I wanna make sure I’ve got, give them the resources that they need, but also give them the direction that they need. And, and having this legal background, what was really great about it is when you’re a lawyer, you’re in every important meeting. So you’re in all the board meetings, admitting everything. You’re in the board meetings, you’re in the compensation meetings, you’re in the internal audit meetings. So you really learn everything about a business, everything that goes right and everything that goes wrong. So that really helped me understand what it was like or what it would be like to manage a company. And then I had this strange seven year stint of heading global distribution, which is, that was very interesting. I didn’t want that job at all. The CEO of our firm came to me and said, I don’t really need a chief operating officer, but what I do need is a global head of distribution. Can you build a centralized global sales team? And oh, by the way, your compensation’s gonna be tied to assets raised, which is the first time that had ever happened in my life. Right. 00:14:41 [Speaker Changed] Interesting. Perspective change, eating what you kill, right? 00:14:44 [Speaker Changed] Yes. I had never sold anything either. So again, what I had to do there was be comfortable with hiring really smart people. So I analyzed the landscape, figured out where there was demand for our products, made sure we had the right products to sell, made sure that the regulatory and the expense hurdles weren’t too high to go in. And then I had to build a lean team of very smart salespeople that could sell our products in these various jurisdictions. But also, when you think you’re managing people so far away from you, the distance is so vast that you have to trust them. We had people in Dubai, I need to make sure those people are doing what they say they’re doing, and that I can trust them. And nevermind. Also, we had people in China, Hong Kong, Tokyo, sometimes we had language barriers. So again, I had to make sure that I hired the best people that I could really trust to do what they needed to do. And then again, let them go. I also needed to learn fast that when somebody is not right or not a good cultural fit, that you need to make a change very, very quickly. 00:15:40 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. No, to say the very least. So let’s talk a little bit about your work with PG imm. They are one of the world’s top 20 asset managers. Well over a trillion dollars. What was it like settling into such a giant firm coming from more reasonable sized firms in, in the early part of your career? 00:16:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, I came from a more reasonably sized firm. It was a very, very easy transition for me because I spent 17 years at a, an insurance owned, multi boutique at the head office in various executive positions. So it was a surprisingly easy transition for me 00:16:21 [Speaker Changed] Because of the insurance background or because of just 00:16:24 [Speaker Changed] The multi boutique background. So I wasn’t on the insurance side. So I was at the asset management arm of the old mutual insurance enterprise. And I worked at the head office. I was after I was general counsel, I was chief operating officer and head of affiliate management. So I oversaw 19 different investment boutiques that frankly spanned the gamut of offerings. We had timber, we had real estate, we had global fixed income, quant equity, fundamental equity, managed futures, everyth, you name it, we had it. And, 00:16:58 [Speaker Changed] And Old Mutual is 00:17:00 [Speaker Changed] The main South Africa, London, New York, Boston. 00:17:03 [Speaker Changed] Boston. Okay. So you, you’re used to working across timelines and regions. 00:17:08 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And having worked in that environment for so long, made moving over to PGIM and P GM Quant Solutions, a pretty easy transition for me. I was really excited about it. I had been watching PGIM, I had been watching their reputation and their brand grow exponentially under David Hunt’s leadership. And then I had also known a lot about PGIM quant at the time was called QMA. And we had a firm at Old Mutual two firms, Acadian and Analytic, who are both quant firms. And I sat on both of their boards for years. And as head of affiliate management, you’re responsible for their p and ls. So you are in their shorts with respect to their strategy, their product development, any lift outs they would do, making sure they had appropriate distribution resources and funding, made sure their succession plans were set and were executed seamlessly. 00:18:00 So I spent a lot of time with quantitative firms, and I really, really liked it. Coming from a math science background, I very much liked the systematic nature of a quant firm. But I also liked, at PM Quant, we like to call it the fusion of art and science. So you have the fundamental insights plus the systematic. And while I am a math science person, I am very, very artsy and creative. I love a good craft. My daughter got married two weeks ago, and I spent my winter, last summer learning how to decoupage oyster shells with maps of the cape and gold gilding along the edges. So I, I spent, I don’t know how many weekends doing 200 of these over the winter last year. So that is, that is a little snapshot into my life. But to take it back, so I very much like sort of the art and science of quant investing. 00:18:53 So it was a natural fit for me to come to PGM, but also to come to PGIM quant. And it’s been, it was remarkably easy to transition to the firm and more interesting to me when I became COO, I expected, frankly, organ rejection because I didn’t come from the investment management side of the business. Right. And often you think that investment professionals want CEOs who are investment professionals. And I was shocked and delighted, frankly, when I was appointed Chief operating officer of PGM Quant that the investment group embraced it. They loved the fact that I would support them and lean into them and really let them do what they do and not micromanage them. So 00:19:40 [Speaker Changed] CIO and CEO are very, very different skill sets. CIO you’re essentially dealing with a, a probabilistic process trying to make assessments about an unknown outcome in the future. CEOs have to manage people, they have to manage budgets. It’s much more blocking and tackling and less probabilistic than the investment side. So the fact that you are now CEO of this group of quants, but don’t have a background as ACIO that I don’t think that at all would work to your disadvantage. 00:20:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I saw it in real life when, you know, being part of a multi boutique and being on the boards of 19 investment managers, I saw the difference between the CEOs that had been investment professionals or CIOs and the ones that were heads of distribution or were an operations. It, it is interesting though, the majority are either in distribution or CIOs. Right. They don’t tend to be lawyers. So, but regardless, I I do think that CIOs tend, if I’m going to stereotype, they tend to do better managing money 00:20:49 [Speaker Changed] Than people. I think. So. You know, that’s absolutely, I I don’t think that that’s over generalizing at all. What’s, what’s kind of interesting is, I thought the ease going from Old Mutual to PGM given both of their insurance backgrounds might’ve been that. But you’re suggesting it was less had to do with that and more had to do with just running a broad assortment of different groups, departments, division, strategies, et cetera. Yeah, 00:21:18 [Speaker Changed] Both PGIM and all Mutual are similar with respect to their investment management. Businesses tend to be pretty separate and distinct from their insurance businesses. So they report in and they have, you know, quarterly business reviews and all of that stuff. And they, they dovetail nicely, but they, they really are run separately. 00:21:38 [Speaker Changed] So you were general counsel and, and how to manage a large group of attorneys, and now you’re managing a large group of quants. Any similarities or differences that, that are noteworthy between herding each herd of cats over there? 00:21:53 [Speaker Changed] There are similarities in that they both tend to be meticulous. So they’re, they’re both type A, they’re both very, very smart and they tend to get into the weeds and the details. So you have to constantly take them up. So at our firm, putting portfolio managers in front of prospects and clients, we constantly have to train them, give them presentation training. We need to often bring in CPMs to help translate their knowledge into layman’s terms. 00:22:23 [Speaker Changed] CCPM being? 00:22:24 [Speaker Changed] Being client portfolio managers. So these are the people that explain what we do in layman’s terms to 00:22:30 [Speaker Changed] Prospects, client facing. 00:22:32 [Speaker Changed] Yes. And many of our, as I said before, many of our investment professionals or introverts, they do not wanna be in front of clients or prospects. Lawyers can be the same. And you often have to get lawyers to think like business people. You do the same thing with investment professionals. They don’t have to think like business professional as much as lawyers do, but they still need to adjust their thinking a little bit. And I often need to change my leadership style. And I learned early on, I took a personality profiling test, I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of it. It’s called Insights Discovery. And they put you into a color bracket, and I’m red, which means I, I tend to like people to be, be bright, be brief, and be gone. That’s how I like people to interact with me. But there are a lot of people that want a lot of data. They want a lot of information. You need to spend time with them. You need to ask them how their kids are. Some are extroverts, they don’t care about the topic. They just wanna have fun. You know, others care more about socializing. There’s a lot of different ways people like to take in information. So when you’re managing lawyers and you’re managing quants, there is something similar there. Managing distribution people is a whole different ball of wax though. That, that, that was fascinating when I managed distribution group
00:23:47 [Speaker Changed] Salespeople respond to financial incentives. 00:23:50 [Speaker Changed] They do. They’re all, they also can be very needy. Oh really? They can, and they can require a lot of your time. And they also want to be praised quite a bit, huh. Which is interesting. Although everybody, I think everyone likes praise, 00:24:03 [Speaker Changed] I guess. But I, I, if you are on a variable comp system, depending on how successful you raise assets, it’s there in black and white on the sales log, you’ve raised X, Hey, do I really need to tell you? This is fantastic. You did a great job this quarter. You 00:24:20 [Speaker Changed] Do actually, what I did learn is you do, and the more you do it, the better they perform. Now. Now, I think again, that works everywhere. What do they say? You have to say something positive X number of times that you The 00:24:30 [Speaker Changed] Sandwich. Yeah. If you’re gonna say something negative, you gotta put something positive on either, either side of it. Either side of it, the criticism sandwich. Okay. I find that amusing. So let’s drill down a little bit to the various quant strategies that PGM utilizes. Is it different asset classes, different geographies, different strategies? What is the full spectrum of offerings PGM has for their quant group? 00:24:53 [Speaker Changed] Short answer is all of the above. So PGIM quant is divided into three platforms. We have our quant equity platform, which manages risk control equity portfolios that are, we’re quants. So they’re model and factor driven. They cover core value, opportunistic equity and indexing. Then we have a multi-asset platform. The multi-asset platform manages things like offerings that give you inflation, hedging against inflation. So we use publicly traded real assets and commodities. We do defensive equity strategies. We also do asset allocation and overlays. And then we have a third platform, which PIM quant acquired right before I Jo joined, which was another interest of mine, was integrating a new firm into the fold. And this is PIM Wanni, it’s our London-based liquid alternatives firm. It offers global macro trend following. It also has inflation hedging products, as well as macro tail risk products. So we kind of cover and, and we go up and down the market spectrum from micro cap all the way up to large cap. And then we go across geographies. So we’ll do, you know, US International, EM, Ex-China, you name it, we, we offer most of it in quant form. The one thing we don’t offer is privates. Huh. Really? Our, our sister company does that. 00:26:19 [Speaker Changed] What’s the name of the sister company? 00:26:20 [Speaker Changed] We have, well, P GM Private Capital. We have p GM real estate. We actually have six sisters. We have p Fixed income, Jenison P Portfolio advisory, and PM Investments. Those all wrapped together make up that $1.2 trillion. That is p gm. 00:26:38 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. So let’s talk a little bit about multi-asset opportunities. Starting with, you have a year, like last year, 2022, stocks are down, bonds are down. All these asset classes are under pressure. How does that affect all the various strategies that you guys are running? 00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] Well, clearly the markets affect our strategies, but that, that’s one of the reasons that we feel strongly that that quants excel in volatile times. Mostly because they have a long- term approach. They’re data-driven. They’re disciplined. They’re diversified. So we have 300 plus stocks in our portfolios. We look at hundreds of pieces of data on 10,000 companies every day. So we’re very, very diversified. But the other thing about being a quant, which is nice, is it it removes the, the emotional bias from picking socks. So you don’t get caught up in what’s going on in the market and, and freaking out in essence and, and making bad decisions. You have your models to ground you Sure there’s fundamental insights on top and there are people here back to that fusion of art and science. But we have the models as our bedrock. 00:27:53 [Speaker Changed] So given what 2022 is like, and obviously very challenging, what’s it like when the calendar flips, really it was last October, 2022 when markets bottomed and, and took off. How does that change in, in market regime affect how you’re going about your business? Or is it, you know, still the same thing, just whether market’s going up and down, you’re still applying the same strategies? 00:28:18 [Speaker Changed] We’re applying the same strategies. But having said that, and, and again, we offer so many different strategies, but what we do have, and IT people have been very, very interested in them, are sort of that infl, the inflation hedging strategies that we offer. The custom mandates. We’re all about sort of solving our clients’ needs, not only today, but tomorrow. So how do we work with those clients to figure out what they’re trying to solve for? Some are want downside protection. So we’ve been recently putting together portfolios that have downside protection. They might limit the upside a little bit. We can adjust that depending on our client’s preferences and needs and wants. The macro tail risk products, the inflation hedging products, all of these different things that are helping clients right now move away from the 60 40 portfolio is just not working for clients right now. And sure, they, they wanna put money into privates. Privates are big right now. And PGIM is leaning into our privates and our alts, meaning PGIM at our head office. But at the same time, people need liquid investments. And so what we provide for them is liquid solutions to help them navigate through these turbulent times. 00:29:32 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Re really interesting. So, so the bulk of of what you’re doing is liquid. You don’t need a gate to get out. These are all stocks, bonds, other assets that are readily tradable any given day. Yep. 00:29:50 [Speaker Changed] All liquid, including publicly traded real assets and commodities. Clearly liquidity’s a little tougher with sort of the micro cap and the small. Sure. So what we do, what our models do there is they assess the trading costs of getting in and out of companies. ’cause we wanna make sure, of course, that you don’t pay more in trading costs to get out than your alpha. So we have to pay attention to that. We also have people that use us for overlay strategies and they often have to get out on a dime. So we need to make sure that everything is very, very liquid. 00:30:19 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That, that’s really interesting. How bespoke are the portfolios and the solutions that you come up with for clients? Are they really customized for individual institutions or how do you think about that approach? 00:30:37 [Speaker Changed] They’re extremely customizable across all of our platforms. So even, I’ll give you an example. Our quant equity platform, we have an ESG solutions offering. We had a very, very large ENF endowment and foundation come to us and say we need to get, we need to solve for our ESG needs and we want to do that. We wanna track a certain index, but we wanna take energy out of the portfolio. So what we’ve been able to do is we’ve been able to help investors solve for their ESG needs wherever they are in their journey. And I, and I get that it’s different for different people. Sure. But that’s what’s really unique about our offerings is that we’re able to sit there and talk to you and say, Barry, what’s important to you? Do you care about water usage? Do you care about women on boards? Do you care about energy? Do you care about carbon footprint? How much do you want it to impact your returns? Or maybe you don’t want it to impact your returns at all. So how do we work with you to create a portfolio that does what you’re, you know, what you wish. So that’s been really interesting and we’ve gotten a lot of traction there. Huh. 00:31:44 [Speaker Changed] Really super intriguing. So you mentioned some people are looking for inflation hedging. I would imagine that would’ve been really useful last year. Are you still getting demand for that? Given how far CPI has fallen from the peak, when was that? June, 2022, something like that. Is there still a demand for inflation hedging? 00:32:07 [Speaker Changed] There still is. It may not be as in demand as it’s been, but if you think about where we are, the macro environment is so uncertain. People still don’t know whether we’re gonna have a recession. People don’t know. People are assuming there’s gonna be a recession in Europe. So people just don’t know. So I think they’re really trying to, pardon the use of the word hedge, but hedge their betts and make sure that they have downside protection. And people get a bit scared in, in this type of environment and they wanna diversify their portfolio. So we just, what what we wanna do is we wanna partner with our clients and they might have any number of needs. They might have, you know, risk parameters, they might have liquidity needs, they might wanna track a benchmark. They might wanna just absolute return. They might want real return. Whatever they need, we will solve for. 00:33:03 [Speaker Changed] So about half of your clients, ballpark are large institutions. You mentioned endowments and, and foundations. And given the background of PGIM with insurance, I think about future liabilities. Is there a lot of matching, Hey, in 2035 we have this sort of expected demand on, on our capital. How important is, is future liability matching to custom solutions? 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] It’s not, we don’t do as much of that at, at PGM quant. So we do manage money for the Prudential general account, but it tends to be in equities. And we do manage some money for them through our P GM wood one. But as you know, insurance companies have various constraints and they need to solve for these things. And they have much smaller buckets of risk assets. So should insurance companies invest in equities, we very much want to be a part of that. And we do manage equities on behalf of our parent company. But lucky for us is, is we don’t, we don’t have to think about paying claims. We just have to think about managing the money in the best way that we can. 00:34:11 [Speaker Changed] What about, since people are talking about hedging, how do you think about risk management? Are you looking at a series of small wins or is there sometimes a Hey, we’re gonna take a big bet ’cause we have a lot of conviction here. So 00:34:26 [Speaker Changed] Risk management is very much embedded in our process. So it’s not an afterthought. It is something that we pay attention to. And clearly you have to take risk if you’re gonna get gain. So, but what our models try to do is take the, the risks, the risks that are going to benefit us and then manage the risks that are not, we tend to take a lot of singles and be consistent, but it depends on what our clients are looking for. So I say that with respect to our equity book. But then we have also, we take much, you know, larger betts with our P Jim Wood one platform as well as if you’re thinking about maybe a small cap investment versus a large cap investment. So it really goes up and down the gamut, depending on what our clients are looking for, what their risk tolerances are, we try to solve for their risk needs. And again, quants can do that pretty effectively because of their process. 00:35:18 [Speaker Changed] So how big a differentiator is PGIM quantitative solutions to PIM? Again, given the insurance background, I don’t know of a lot of other large insurers whose financial arms are leaning this heavily into the quant side. 00:35:37 [Speaker Changed] I think it’s a, it’s a big differentiator for PGIM one. I just, PGIM has one of, as you mentioned, one of the broadest asset management offerings out there. And I feel like quant is a very important component to the offering. Especially how, if you think about how technology is advancing and it’s becoming more and more a part of our lives, AI is evolving and we’ve been doing that for a long, long time. So I think it’s just natural to have a quant manager as part of your stable of offerings. But yes, I do believe that it’s a differentiator for peach. M huh. 00:36:10 [Speaker Changed] Really, really intriguing. So, so there’s a couple of quotes of yours that I have to ask about ’cause they’re kind of fascinating. Quote, softer skills are more valuable than ever. They are what clients want. So, so first I have to ask, what do you mean by softer skills? Tell us about that. 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] I often refer to softer skills when I am talking about women in management. Actually, when you think about the ability to connect with people, to really listen, to understand what their wants and needs are, that many people don’t do that. And I feel like, I feel as though softer skills, especially in this tech enabled environment. So in a hybrid environment, when you are streaming and dealing with people by zoom and teams and you’re not seeing people in the hallway, these softer skills really, really differentiate you. And one of the things that I’ve been doing as CEO during co, what I did during Covid and I’ve continued to do now, is you lack that ability to run into people in the kitchen and to, to connect with them and really build a relationship. Because I do believe that building relationships is important to building trust. Building trust is essential to building working relationships with your business partners. 00:37:33 And so what I started doing was, I started doing a video series, if you think carpool karaoke, I would drive my, my dog to the dog park in the mornings and it was about a 40 minute drive and I would do a lot of reflecting and thinking about strategy people, whatever I was doing at work. And instead of thinking about it, I thought, I’m gonna do some little video segments, two minutes, didn’t really think about what I was gonna say, just got on the video and talked to the employees of our company. And I did that regularly so they would know what I’m up to, what I’m thinking about. They knew a little about me personally, but they also knew what I was thinking about, what the management team was thinking about and what we were up to. And that’s an example of a softer skill that it’s that ability to connect with people and to think about how you can connect with people in different ways to build their trust and get to know you better. 00:38:29 [Speaker Changed] You, you mentioned the various hybrid work options that especially what took place during the pandemic. Are you guys still operating on a hybrid basis and and what does that do for you? 00:38:43 [Speaker Changed] We are, we’re working in a hybrid three days in the office. Two days work from home. And I believe that it’s the best of both worlds because we have those three days to collaborate, to continue to get to know each other, to brainstorm. And then we have two days that we can do heads down work, meaning the, the work from home days. And I also feel that we get a lot of credit for doing that with our employees, our employment, our employees are happier in this environment. It’s what they want, it’s what they’re getting used to. And I was just listening to actually Bloomberg this morning where they were talking about how the trains are getting busier and workplaces are going, are, are changing their hybrid schedules. So I’ll be interested to see what happens in the next year or so with respect to hybrid. But I think right now it’s a pretty good balance. 00:39:38 [Speaker Changed] Does it, does it help with employee retention and, and even new hires? 00:39:43 [Speaker Changed] It does. We’ve actually had certain people that wanted full work from home, which we don’t do. So it, it is something that I believe companies need to do. They need to pay attention to that. I think you, our offices are in Newark, New Jersey, so hybrid is pretty appealing and I, I do think it’s a differentiator or maybe it’s not even a differentiator. It might just be table stakes, 00:40:11 [Speaker Changed] Right. Amongst the big banks, a lot of them have been gone back to JP Morgan, chase, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, a lot of these have gone back to five days in the office and there’s been some pushback, not so much from the young 20 somethings who really need to be immersed, but the, the slightly older generation, late twenties, early thirties who, who really know how to work remote. 00:40:36 [Speaker Changed] Right. I believe it’s important for the younger generation because you want that mentoring. You wanna be able to, again, run into people in the halls, get to know them, get to understand what they do. And, and I do think that’s important. I think flexibility is also important to, many, many have either young kids at home or they have ailing parents or they have hobbies or they just have wellness goals. So getting that balance right can be tricky. But this is again, why I think the three days is, is a good balance. It, it’s a nice way to solve for our employees’ needs, but also get the work done and build a culture, building a culture. We haven’t talked much about that, but it, it, one of the first things that I did when I took over as CEO was work with the employees to reset our values and then not only reset them, but then drive them home and live by them and make changes based on them. And I think that building that culture, it’s very, very difficult to do if you’re in a fully work from home environment. 00:41:38 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, that makes, that makes a lot of sense. Last, last quote of yours. You’ve talked a lot about leadership and diversity, especially when it comes to women in finance. Tell us a little bit about your thoughts about the best strategies for leading in an industry that’s spent so many decades as a male dominated bastion. 00:42:04 [Speaker Changed] Again, it’s lean into those softer skills. I think it’s a trifecta of opportunity right now for women. So you have companies and boards that are trying to increase their diversity stats so they’re more open to women in senior leadership positions. The hybrid work environment makes it easier for women that are balancing multiple, multiple different chores and responsibilities. And then you have the benefit of women having these softer skills that work in this new te tech enabled environment. So I think it’s a, a great opportunity for women going forward. I think the issue really is the pipeline. And one of the things that I’m passionate about and we’re doing a lot with at PGM Quant is we’re going out and doing community work. We’re reaching out into the newer community and we’re working with kids as young as elementary school kids. Wow. So we’re, we’re getting them interested in asset management. We’re doing things like Shark Tank and job fairs and things like that, that are kind of mock job fairs. And it’s just been really rewarding for us because we have to start at such a young age. So these, these women and other diverse populations will continue to have an interest in asset management. You’re, 00:43:20 [Speaker Changed] You’re playing a long game, you’re planting seeds 10, 15 years in advance. ’cause none of this is gonna pay off for a long time. 00:43:29 [Speaker Changed] We need to be patient as, as we invest for the long term, we need to be patient. So, but not complacent. 00:43:36 [Speaker Changed] Not complacent. So, so let’s jump to our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests. Starting with, Hey, what kept you entertained during the lockdown? What are you, what are you streaming these days? 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Gosh. Meaning streaming on television. 00:43:52 [Speaker Changed] Sure. Television podcast doesn’t matter. Yeah. What whatever, whatever audio, video is entertaining you. So 00:43:58 [Speaker Changed] I like documentaries. So what I was looking or watching this weekend was fantastic fungi, which I highly recommend. This is all about the medicinal and healing properties of mushrooms. If one has ailing parents or is having health issues, I highly encourage you to tune in. But it is also a beautifully, beautifully filmed documentary. Hmm. I also live on the Cape, so I had to, you know, the shark population is booming, so I had had to watch after the Bite, which is all about the, the shark population on Cape Cod. But other than that, as far as sort of more mainstream, I, I did like Ted lasso very much. It was what’s not to love. Right. Entertaining. You always got a good tidbit of knowledge. Like be an authentic leader, you know, lean into your insecurities. I never turned that off about picking up some little tidbit of information. As far as podcasts, I get most of my news by email feed. So I tend to do that more as a hobby. So I do, I’m very interested right now in longevity and health. So I listened to something called the Cabral Concept by Dr. Steven Cabral, which talks about all sorts of things. One of the things I was looking into was an infrared sauna and a cold plunge. So my husband and I just recently purchased both of those things. 00:45:24 [Speaker Changed] We, I have a buddy who is crazy into the cold plunge and whatever that breathing technique is Yep. That you need to do. And I committed to doing a cold plunge next summer. So we’ll see how that goes. I, I’m in the ocean every Memorial Day weekend. Wow. That’s my cold plunge. ’cause that’s like, you know, 60 degrees. But what these guys are talking about is high thirties, low forties, really, really cold. 00:45:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Ours is 49 degrees. Wow. And, and it’s cold. It takes about a minute and 30 seconds to, to numb up. So, so that’s an interesting podcast for me. I do tune into this other podcast, it’s called your CEO Mentor. It’s by the author of No Bull Leadership. And this individual’s name’s Martin Moore. And I totally skipped your conversa your question about the AMP program, which is an advance management program. It’s an elite executive education program. But he was a buddy of mine at the AMP and he wrote a book on leadership. He was the CEO of a company and he wrote a book called No Leadership. And I of course read it out of courtesy because I don’t normally get a lot, frankly out of leadership books. It’s very intuitive to me. But I got quite a few nug nuggets of information from this book and he’s just very entertaining. And so I tune into his podcasts frequently and I get little tidbits like, it’s about respect, not popularity, it’s about excellence, not per perfection, different things like that. It’s just interesting. And he’s Australian, so he’s really interesting to listen to. 00:47:03 [Speaker Changed] So, so you mentioned mentors. That’s my next question. Who are your mentors who helped guide your career? 00:47:10 [Speaker Changed] I have one mentor. She was the lawyer that hired me for that job out of college. Her name is Molly Mugler. And she worked with me my entire career. Her entire career. She’s now retired. So she hired me. I then became general counsel. I moved to Old Mutual. I brought her with me. And what was amazing about her is she believed in me before I did. She had such confidence and vision for me and my future. And she kept referring to herself as my sticky asset that she’d stay with me, but wasn’t. What was inspiring about her is she’s so intelligent and she’s such an accomplished lawyer, but at the same time she was militant about balancing her personal life and her professional life. She prioritized watercolor, painting and tennis equally with her job as a general counsel of a big firm. So to this day, I am still connected with her and I am still constantly inspired by her. 00:48:08 [Speaker Changed] Huh, that’s interesting. Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 00:48:14 [Speaker Changed] My nightstand is a bit eclectic right now. So I have, again, another book on longevity called Out outliving, which has again, to do with health and longevity. I have the Rain barrel effect, which is again, about what you put into your body and how it affects again your health and longevity. But the, the real shocker on there is, I believe it’s called the Modern Textbook of astrology. During Covid I started thinking a lot about astrological charts and I found them fascinating. And they are tied a lot to math and science and they’re very, very technical. And I had my chart read and I said, you know, I’d be interested in learning how to read, read charts. That doesn’t seem that hard. He said, oh, trust me, it’s hard. He gave me the name of three books. He said, start reading and then get back to me. 00:49:05 I might have to postpone that to retirement ’cause it is quite technical, it’s very math forward. But it’s, it’s still interesting. For fun, recently I read the Lincoln Highway. I really liked, I loved, I think it’s called Beneath the Scarlet Sky. What I liked to do back when I was a lawyer, everybody would say, oh, have you re-read the most recent, you know, fiction book on law, you know, Tom Clancy kind of stuff. And I just don’t wanna read things that I’m living. So I don’t wanna read books on investing. I don’t wanna read books on the law. I wanna read books that transport me to another place in time where I can just learn about memoirs of Aisha was, you know, interesting. Oh really? Things like that. Just get outta my own head and think about something different. We do enough re as a lawyer, think about how much you have to read when you, when I read, I wanna read for fun or for gaining knowledge of something different. 00:50:01 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really interesting. Down to our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in either investment, finance, management, or law? 00:50:15 [Speaker Changed] As we’ve been going through this podcast, I, I’ve realized the benefit that my legal profession has had on my management abilities. I, I never quite tied those two things together so much. The broad knowledge that you get from being a business lawyer, i i is quite extreme. So depending on what that person’s interest in interests are, I would say network, network, network. It’s all about talking to people and understanding what they do and understanding what’s out there and really building relationships. That’s really what it’s about. That’s what it’s about in business. That’s what it’s about in dealing with clients, building relationships. It’s, it’s just what it is about life. But it it, but it’s very hard to make that decision. Again, I fell into my career and I’m pretty fortunate that I’ve had a lot of opportunities come my way. But I’m not somebody who says you need a goal and you need to follow it. Because I think if you have blinders on for that one goal, that you’re gonna miss all of these other opportunities that can lead you in a direction that might be much more fruitful for you. Huh, 00:51:23 [Speaker Changed] Interesting. And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today you wish you knew 25 years or so ago when you were first getting started? 00:51:34 [Speaker Changed] Gosh, that one’s more tricky for me. I feel like I was pretty informed back then. But if I can flip it on its head a little bit, maybe it, I’ll answer it as to what advice would I give to those 20 somethings out there now. And I would say understand the benefits of compounding. Make sure you invest early, make sure you’re diverse, and make sure you invest in your 4 0 1 k plan. Because as much as it feels though, as though you can’t afford that extra a hundred dollars or $10 or a thousand dollars, it’s just so important to, to start investing early. 00:52:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, to say the very least kind of that, that decade, twenties to thirties, it makes a huge difference that over 40 years 00:52:15 [Speaker Changed] It does for sure. 00:52:17 [Speaker Changed] Linda, thank you for being so generous with your time.

 New research reveals millions of people around the world living in poverty have been experiencing a ""climate hazard flip"" since the turn of the century.

										  
											        






This comes at a pivotal moment, as world leaders prepare to meet in Dubai for COP28.
The research from WaterAid features stark satellite imagery and analysis of climate data in partnership with the University of Bristol and Cardiff University.
Findings shows that under a ""whiplash"" of extreme climate pressures, areas that used to experience frequent droughts are now more prone to frequent flooding, while other regions historically prone to flooding now endure more frequent droughts. This is having a devastating impact on communities in these regions.
Co-lead researcher Prof Katerina Michaelides, professor of dryland hydrology at the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment, said, ""We have come to understand that climate change will not lead to a monolithic change to climatic hazards, despite globally increasing temperatures. Instead, the hazard profile for any region is likely to change in unpredictable ways. These factors must be considered to support climate adaptation for the lives and livelihoods of humans across the globe.""
Over the last two decades, areas in Pakistan, Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana—normally associated with hotter, drier conditions—have flipped to become increasingly wetter and flood-prone.
By contrast, the southern Shabelle region of Ethiopia, which between 1980 and 2000 experienced numerous periods of flooding, now shows a shift towards prolonged and severe drought. The drier Shabelle River—a major water source for Somalia—recently experienced the worst of the drought conditions in the Horn of Africa but ended with a major flood in April this year.
It is a phenomenon mirrored in Northern Italy where the data shows the number of intense dry spells experienced by both countries has more than doubled since 2000. But these are punctuated by risks of extreme flooding, as the Lombardy floods of May and July this year illustrate.
The innovative research examined the frequency and magnitude of flooding and drought hazards over the last 41 years in locations across six countries where WaterAid works: Pakistan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mozambique, adding Italy for a European comparison to address the fact that the impacts of climate change do not discriminate by region.


											  													    





Co-lead researcher, Professor Michael Singer of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Cardiff University, warned these climatic phenomena are not just confined to these countries.
He said, ""Most dramatically, we found that many locations are undergoing major shifts in the prevailing climate. Specifically, many of our study sites have experienced a hazard flip from being drought-prone to flood-prone or vice versa.
""Although the scope of this study was limited to a handful of countries and specific locations within them, we believe the hazard flip and, more generally, changes to flood and drought hazard frequency and magnitude are something most places on the planet will have to address.""
Communities exposed to these extremes are often ill-equipped to deal with them. WaterAid cautions that failure to act on climate adaptation at COP28 could condemn people in the worst affected areas to entrenched poverty, displacement, disease and potentially even conflict, as issues leading to water and food scarcity are made worse by catastrophic and changeable climatic extremes.
For communities living on the front line of these ""climate hazard flips,"" the consequences are devastating—wiping out crops and livelihoods, damaging often-fragile water supply infrastructure, disrupting water supply services, and exposing people to disease and death.
In 2022, the village of Bachal Bheel in the Badin region of southeast Pakistan was devastated by catastrophic flooding that engulfed two thirds of the country. Local resident and widow, Soni Bheel recalls a childhood when local agriculture prospered with an adequate balance between heat and water supplies, allowing villagers to enjoy ""robust health.""
The situation is now very different. Soni, aged 83, said, ""Our village was washed away in the flood, but it taught us a vital lesson: we must build our houses on higher ground to protect them from future floods. We're now elevating our homes with a two-foot-high platform.""
In Uganda, the data shows that Mbale, an Eastern region in the shadow of Mount Elgon, is also showing a significant tendency towards much wetter conditions, as demonstrated by unprecedented flooding over the last three years.
For retired primary school teacher, Okecho Opondo, 70, the change in weather patterns is causing huge problems.
Okecho said, ""We are in total confusion. The months that used to be rainy are now dry. When the rains come, they can be short yet heavy, leading to floods. On other occasions the rainy periods are too long, leading to destruction of infrastructure and crop failure. And then the dry periods can be very long, further leading to crop failure and hunger.""
Two measures the local community have tried to mitigate the climate uncertainty are to plant hedges around their crops to help prevent soil erosion and to move latrines well away from potential flood zones. One person spoke of planting bamboo forests on the slopes of nearby Mount Elgon to try to prevent landslides.
Meanwhile in Mozambique, in the highly urbanized areas around the capital of Maputo, the data shows the situation as highly variable, characterized by prolonged drought periods punctuated by floods.
Kiequer, aged 14, said, ""The floods really affected my education. My academic knowledge went with the water. I was traumatized by that February rain. When the sky gets cloudy, I always get scared. I don't think that day of the floods will ever leave my imagination.""
From flood protection to drought resistance measures—adaptation solutions exist, but not enough is being done to prepare for this future. Scaling up and optimizing water-related investments in low and middle-income countries will not only save lives, it will boost economic prosperity—with analysis suggesting it can deliver at least $500 billion a year in economic value.
WaterAid is calling on world leaders at COP28 this year to prioritize clean water, decent sanitation and good hygiene as a key component to climate adaptation programs as well as rapidly scale up in investment in water security in low- and middle-income countries:
High income countries must more than double their public finance for adaptation from 2019 levels by 2025 and match climate funding amounts to mitigation funding. High income country governments, financing institutions and the private sector should provide at least £500m towards a total of £5–10bn needed for water security over the next 4 years. In the U.K., following a series of rowbacks on climate commitments, WaterAid is calling on Rishi Sunak to show leadership at COP28 —including the U.K. government investing one third of the U.K.'s international climate finance budget towards locally led adaptation projects that will bring a year-round supply of clean water to those most in need—and to influence other global governments to make similar commitments.
Tim Wainwright, WaterAid's Chief Executive, said, ""The climate crisis is a water crisis and, as our research today shows, our climate has become increasingly unpredictable with devastating consequences.
""From drought-stricken farmlands to flood-ravaged settlements, communities in Pakistan, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Ethiopia are all experiencing alarming climate whiplash effects; Uganda is experiencing ever more catastrophic flooding and Mozambique a chaotic mix of both extremes.
""While we will all pay a price for global water stress, it's those living on the frontline of the climate crisis who are paying for it now—their lives hanging in the balance.
""COP28 is only two weeks away and it cannot be another summit where the climate adaptation can is kicked down the road. Our leaders must recognize the urgency and prioritize investment into robust and resilient water systems now.""
WaterAid is calling on the public to join its Our Climate Fight campaign and urge the U.K. Government to increase investment in climate adaptation. More than 20,000 people have already signed the petition.
Tim Wainwright concluded, ""For the world's most vulnerable, this is a matter of life or death. We cannot let climate change wash away peoples' futures.""

Communities exposed to these extremes are often ill-equipped to deal with them. WaterAid cautions that failure to act on climate adaptation at COP28 could condemn people in the worst affected areas to entrenched poverty, displacement, disease and potentially even conflict, as issues leading to water and food scarcity are made worse by catastrophic and changeable climatic extremes.
For communities living on the front line of these ""climate hazard flips,"" the consequences are devastating—wiping out crops and livelihoods, damaging often-fragile water supply infrastructure, disrupting water supply services, and exposing people to disease and death.
In 2022, the village of Bachal Bheel in the Badin region of southeast Pakistan was devastated by catastrophic flooding that engulfed two thirds of the country. Local resident and widow, Soni Bheel recalls a childhood when local agriculture prospered with an adequate balance between heat and water supplies, allowing villagers to enjoy ""robust health.""
The situation is now very different. Soni, aged 83, said, ""Our village was washed away in the flood, but it taught us a vital lesson: we must build our houses on higher ground to protect them from future floods. We're now elevating our homes with a two-foot-high platform.""
In Uganda, the data shows that Mbale, an Eastern region in the shadow of Mount Elgon, is also showing a significant tendency towards much wetter conditions, as demonstrated by unprecedented flooding over the last three years.
For retired primary school teacher, Okecho Opondo, 70, the change in weather patterns is causing huge problems.
Okecho said, ""We are in total confusion. The months that used to be rainy are now dry. When the rains come, they can be short yet heavy, leading to floods. On other occasions the rainy periods are too long, leading to destruction of infrastructure and crop failure. And then the dry periods can be very long, further leading to crop failure and hunger.""
Two measures the local community have tried to mitigate the climate uncertainty are to plant hedges around their crops to help prevent soil erosion and to move latrines well away from potential flood zones. One person spoke of planting bamboo forests on the slopes of nearby Mount Elgon to try to prevent landslides.
Meanwhile in Mozambique, in the highly urbanized areas around the capital of Maputo, the data shows the situation as highly variable, characterized by prolonged drought periods punctuated by floods.

From flood protection to drought resistance measures—adaptation solutions exist, but not enough is being done to prepare for this future. Scaling up and optimizing water-related investments in low and middle-income countries will not only save lives, it will boost economic prosperity—with analysis suggesting it can deliver at least $500 billion a year in economic value.
WaterAid is calling on world leaders at COP28 this year to prioritize clean water, decent sanitation and good hygiene as a key component to climate adaptation programs as well as rapidly scale up in investment in water security in low- and middle-income countries:
High income countries must more than double their public finance for adaptation from 2019 levels by 2025 and match climate funding amounts to mitigation funding. High income country governments, financing institutions and the private sector should provide at least £500m towards a total of £5–10bn needed for water security over the next 4 years. In the U.K., following a series of rowbacks on climate commitments, WaterAid is calling on Rishi Sunak to show leadership at COP28 —including the U.K. government investing one third of the U.K.'s international climate finance budget towards locally led adaptation projects that will bring a year-round supply of clean water to those most in need—and to influence other global governments to make similar commitments.
Tim Wainwright, WaterAid's Chief Executive, said, ""The climate crisis is a water crisis and, as our research today shows, our climate has become increasingly unpredictable with devastating consequences.
""From drought-stricken farmlands to flood-ravaged settlements, communities in Pakistan, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Ethiopia are all experiencing alarming climate whiplash effects; Uganda is experiencing ever more catastrophic flooding and Mozambique a chaotic mix of both extremes.

""COP28 is only two weeks away and it cannot be another summit where the climate adaptation can is kicked down the road. Our leaders must recognize the urgency and prioritize investment into robust and resilient water systems now.""
WaterAid is calling on the public to join its Our Climate Fight campaign and urge the U.K. Government to increase investment in climate adaptation. More than 20,000 people have already signed the petition.

 Findings shows that under a ""whiplash"" of extreme climate pressures, areas that used to experience frequent droughts are now more prone to frequent flooding, while other regions historically prone to flooding now endure more frequent droughts. This is having a devastating impact on communities in these regions.
Co-lead researcher Prof Katerina Michaelides, professor of dryland hydrology at the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment, said, ""We have come to understand that climate change will not lead to a monolithic change to climatic hazards, despite globally increasing temperatures. Instead, the hazard profile for any region is likely to change in unpredictable ways. These factors must be considered to support climate adaptation for the lives and livelihoods of humans across the globe.""
Over the last two decades, areas in Pakistan, Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana—normally associated with hotter, drier conditions—have flipped to become increasingly wetter and flood-prone.
By contrast, the southern Shabelle region of Ethiopia, which between 1980 and 2000 experienced numerous periods of flooding, now shows a shift towards prolonged and severe drought. The drier Shabelle River—a major water source for Somalia—recently experienced the worst of the drought conditions in the Horn of Africa but ended with a major flood in April this year.
It is a phenomenon mirrored in Northern Italy where the data shows the number of intense dry spells experienced by both countries has more than doubled since 2000. But these are punctuated by risks of extreme flooding, as the Lombardy floods of May and July this year illustrate.
The innovative research examined the frequency and magnitude of flooding and drought hazards over the last 41 years in locations across six countries where WaterAid works: Pakistan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mozambique, adding Italy for a European comparison to address the fact that the impacts of climate change do not discriminate by region.


											  													    





Co-lead researcher, Professor Michael Singer of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Cardiff University, warned these climatic phenomena are not just confined to these countries.
He said, ""Most dramatically, we found that many locations are undergoing major shifts in the prevailing climate. Specifically, many of our study sites have experienced a hazard flip from being drought-prone to flood-prone or vice versa.

 It is a phenomenon mirrored in Northern Italy where the data shows the number of intense dry spells experienced by both countries has more than doubled since 2000. But these are punctuated by risks of extreme flooding, as the Lombardy floods of May and July this year illustrate.
The innovative research examined the frequency and magnitude of flooding and drought hazards over the last 41 years in locations across six countries where WaterAid works: Pakistan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mozambique, adding Italy for a European comparison to address the fact that the impacts of climate change do not discriminate by region.


											  													    





Co-lead researcher, Professor Michael Singer of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Cardiff University, warned these climatic phenomena are not just confined to these countries.
He said, ""Most dramatically, we found that many locations are undergoing major shifts in the prevailing climate. Specifically, many of our study sites have experienced a hazard flip from being drought-prone to flood-prone or vice versa.
""Although the scope of this study was limited to a handful of countries and specific locations within them, we believe the hazard flip and, more generally, changes to flood and drought hazard frequency and magnitude are something most places on the planet will have to address.""
Communities exposed to these extremes are often ill-equipped to deal with them. WaterAid cautions that failure to act on climate adaptation at COP28 could condemn people in the worst affected areas to entrenched poverty, displacement, disease and potentially even conflict, as issues leading to water and food scarcity are made worse by catastrophic and changeable climatic extremes.
For communities living on the front line of these ""climate hazard flips,"" the consequences are devastating—wiping out crops and livelihoods, damaging often-fragile water supply infrastructure, disrupting water supply services, and exposing people to disease and death.
In 2022, the village of Bachal Bheel in the Badin region of southeast Pakistan was devastated by catastrophic flooding that engulfed two thirds of the country. Local resident and widow, Soni Bheel recalls a childhood when local agriculture prospered with an adequate balance between heat and water supplies, allowing villagers to enjoy ""robust health.""
The situation is now very different. Soni, aged 83, said, ""Our village was washed away in the flood, but it taught us a vital lesson: we must build our houses on higher ground to protect them from future floods. We're now elevating our homes with a two-foot-high platform.""
In Uganda, the data shows that Mbale, an Eastern region in the shadow of Mount Elgon, is also showing a significant tendency towards much wetter conditions, as demonstrated by unprecedented flooding over the last three years.
For retired primary school teacher, Okecho Opondo, 70, the change in weather patterns is causing huge problems.
Okecho said, ""We are in total confusion. The months that used to be rainy are now dry. When the rains come, they can be short yet heavy, leading to floods. On other occasions the rainy periods are too long, leading to destruction of infrastructure and crop failure. And then the dry periods can be very long, further leading to crop failure and hunger.""
Two measures the local community have tried to mitigate the climate uncertainty are to plant hedges around their crops to help prevent soil erosion and to move latrines well away from potential flood zones. One person spoke of planting bamboo forests on the slopes of nearby Mount Elgon to try to prevent landslides.
Meanwhile in Mozambique, in the highly urbanized areas around the capital of Maputo, the data shows the situation as highly variable, characterized by prolonged drought periods punctuated by floods.
Kiequer, aged 14, said, ""The floods really affected my education. My academic knowledge went with the water. I was traumatized by that February rain. When the sky gets cloudy, I always get scared. I don't think that day of the floods will ever leave my imagination.""
From flood protection to drought resistance measures—adaptation solutions exist, but not enough is being done to prepare for this future. Scaling up and optimizing water-related investments in low and middle-income countries will not only save lives, it will boost economic prosperity—with analysis suggesting it can deliver at least $500 billion a year in economic value.
WaterAid is calling on world leaders at COP28 this year to prioritize clean water, decent sanitation and good hygiene as a key component to climate adaptation programs as well as rapidly scale up in investment in water security in low- and middle-income countries:
High income countries must more than double their public finance for adaptation from 2019 levels by 2025 and match climate funding amounts to mitigation funding. High income country governments, financing institutions and the private sector should provide at least £500m towards a total of £5–10bn needed for water security over the next 4 years. In the U.K., following a series of rowbacks on climate commitments, WaterAid is calling on Rishi Sunak to show leadership at COP28 —including the U.K. government investing one third of the U.K.'s international climate finance budget towards locally led adaptation projects that will bring a year-round supply of clean water to those most in need—and to influence other global governments to make similar commitments.
Tim Wainwright, WaterAid's Chief Executive, said, ""The climate crisis is a water crisis and, as our research today shows, our climate has become increasingly unpredictable with devastating consequences.
""From drought-stricken farmlands to flood-ravaged settlements, communities in Pakistan, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Ethiopia are all experiencing alarming climate whiplash effects; Uganda is experiencing ever more catastrophic flooding and Mozambique a chaotic mix of both extremes.
""While we will all pay a price for global water stress, it's those living on the frontline of the climate crisis who are paying for it now—their lives hanging in the balance.
""COP28 is only two weeks away and it cannot be another summit where the climate adaptation can is kicked down the road. Our leaders must recognize the urgency and prioritize investment into robust and resilient water systems now.""
WaterAid is calling on the public to join its Our Climate Fight campaign and urge the U.K. Government to increase investment in climate adaptation. More than 20,000 people have already signed the petition.
Tim Wainwright concluded, ""For the world's most vulnerable, this is a matter of life or death. We cannot let climate change wash away peoples' futures.""

Tim Wainwright, WaterAid's Chief Executive, said, ""The climate crisis is a water crisis and, as our research today shows, our climate has become increasingly unpredictable with devastating consequences.
""From drought-stricken farmlands to flood-ravaged settlements, communities in Pakistan, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Ethiopia are all experiencing alarming climate whiplash effects; Uganda is experiencing ever more catastrophic flooding and Mozambique a chaotic mix of both extremes.
""While we will all pay a price for global water stress, it's those living on the frontline of the climate crisis who are paying for it now—their lives hanging in the balance.
""COP28 is only two weeks away and it cannot be another summit where the climate adaptation can is kicked down the road. Our leaders must recognize the urgency and prioritize investment into robust and resilient water systems now.""
WaterAid is calling on the public to join its Our Climate Fight campaign and urge the U.K. Government to increase investment in climate adaptation. More than 20,000 people have already signed the petition.
Tim Wainwright concluded, ""For the world's most vulnerable, this is a matter of life or death. We cannot let climate change wash away peoples' futures.""

 For communities living on the front line of these ""climate hazard flips,"" the consequences are devastating—wiping out crops and livelihoods, damaging often-fragile water supply infrastructure, disrupting water supply services, and exposing people to disease and death.
In 2022, the village of Bachal Bheel in the Badin region of southeast Pakistan was devastated by catastrophic flooding that engulfed two thirds of the country. Local resident and widow, Soni Bheel recalls a childhood when local agriculture prospered with an adequate balance between heat and water supplies, allowing villagers to enjoy ""robust health.""
The situation is now very different. Soni, aged 83, said, ""Our village was washed away in the flood, but it taught us a vital lesson: we must build our houses on higher ground to protect them from future floods. We're now elevating our homes with a two-foot-high platform.""
In Uganda, the data shows that Mbale, an Eastern region in the shadow of Mount Elgon, is also showing a significant tendency towards much wetter conditions, as demonstrated by unprecedented flooding over the last three years.
For retired primary school teacher, Okecho Opondo, 70, the change in weather patterns is causing huge problems.
Okecho said, ""We are in total confusion. The months that used to be rainy are now dry. When the rains come, they can be short yet heavy, leading to floods. On other occasions the rainy periods are too long, leading to destruction of infrastructure and crop failure. And then the dry periods can be very long, further leading to crop failure and hunger.""
Two measures the local community have tried to mitigate the climate uncertainty are to plant hedges around their crops to help prevent soil erosion and to move latrines well away from potential flood zones. One person spoke of planting bamboo forests on the slopes of nearby Mount Elgon to try to prevent landslides.
Meanwhile in Mozambique, in the highly urbanized areas around the capital of Maputo, the data shows the situation as highly variable, characterized by prolonged drought periods punctuated by floods.
Kiequer, aged 14, said, ""The floods really affected my education. My academic knowledge went with the water. I was traumatized by that February rain. When the sky gets cloudy, I always get scared. I don't think that day of the floods will ever leave my imagination.""
From flood protection to drought resistance measures—adaptation solutions exist, but not enough is being done to prepare for this future. Scaling up and optimizing water-related investments in low and middle-income countries will not only save lives, it will boost economic prosperity—with analysis suggesting it can deliver at least $500 billion a year in economic value.
WaterAid is calling on world leaders at COP28 this year to prioritize clean water, decent sanitation and good hygiene as a key component to climate adaptation programs as well as rapidly scale up in investment in water security in low- and middle-income countries:
High income countries must more than double their public finance for adaptation from 2019 levels by 2025 and match climate funding amounts to mitigation funding. High income country governments, financing institutions and the private sector should provide at least £500m towards a total of £5–10bn needed for water security over the next 4 years.

Tim Wainwright, WaterAid's Chief Executive, said, ""The climate crisis is a water crisis and, as our research today shows, our climate has become increasingly unpredictable with devastating consequences.
""From drought-stricken farmlands to flood-ravaged settlements, communities in Pakistan, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Ethiopia are all experiencing alarming climate whiplash effects; Uganda is experiencing ever more catastrophic flooding and Mozambique a chaotic mix of both extremes.
""While we will all pay a price for global water stress, it's those living on the frontline of the climate crisis who are paying for it now—their lives hanging in the balance.
""COP28 is only two weeks away and it cannot be another summit where the climate adaptation can is kicked down the road. Our leaders must recognize the urgency and prioritize investment into robust and resilient water systems now.""
WaterAid is calling on the public to join its Our Climate Fight campaign and urge the U.K. Government to increase investment in climate adaptation. More than 20,000 people have already signed the petition.
Tim Wainwright concluded, ""For the world's most vulnerable, this is a matter of life or death. We cannot let climate change wash away peoples' futures.""

 Kiequer, aged 14, said, ""The floods really affected my education. My academic knowledge went with the water. I was traumatized by that February rain. When the sky gets cloudy, I always get scared. I don't think that day of the floods will ever leave my imagination.""
From flood protection to drought resistance measures—adaptation solutions exist, but not enough is being done to prepare for this future. Scaling up and optimizing water-related investments in low and middle-income countries will not only save lives, it will boost economic prosperity—with analysis suggesting it can deliver at least $500 billion a year in economic value.
WaterAid is calling on world leaders at COP28 this year to prioritize clean water, decent sanitation and good hygiene as a key component to climate adaptation programs as well as rapidly scale up in investment in water security in low- and middle-income countries:
High income countries must more than double their public finance for adaptation from 2019 levels by 2025 and match climate funding amounts to mitigation funding. High income country governments, financing institutions and the private sector should provide at least £500m towards a total of £5–10bn needed for water security over the next 4 years.

This was as it revealed that Africa may lose 5 per cent to 15 per cent of its projected GDP by 2050 if immediate actions are not taken to mitigate the effects of climate change in the region.
The financial institutions made this known at the ongoing Joint International CEO Forum of the Association of African Development Finance Institutions and the Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and the Pacific hosted by the Bank of Industry in Abuja.
Sunday PUNCH reports that the event attended by bank CEOs from 33 countries across four continents was themed, “DFIs’ Strategic Role towards a Climate Smart Future.” 
The AADFI Chairman, Mr Thabo Thamane, while delivering his address, underscored the severe consequences that least developed countries, particularly those in Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, could face.  Related News

Painting a gloomy picture of the issue at hand, the AADFI Chairman noted that the adverse effects of climate change threaten human health and safety, food and water security, and sustainable socio-economic development globally and ideas.
He said, “It is no longer news that the world is facing the negative impact of climate change. Human health and safety, food and water security, and sustainable socio-economic development are threatened globally.      
“Reports predict that if strategic actions are not taken to combat climate change, the world economy will lose more than 18% of its current GDP by 2048, and the least developed countries, particularly those in Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, will suffer the worst consequences.
“Africa, for instance, is estimated to lose 5 per cent to 15 per cent of its projected GDP by 2050, with a projected climate adaptation cost of $10 to $30 billion annually by 2030. At the same time, the Asia and ASEAN countries are projected to lose 26.5 per cent and 37.4 per cent of their GDP by 2048 if immediate action is not taken to mitigate the effects of climate change.

                        Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy  Aleksandar Tomic/Alamy Dubai Silicon Oasis, a free zone that promotes the tech industry, United Arab Emirates, May 2021 To stand on the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building in 1950 was to stand atop the world. From the world’s tallest building you could gaze down upon Wall Street, the world’s financial center. Or you could look uptown toward the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the world’s largest art museums. The ships leaving port belonged to the world’s largest merchant fleet, and the goods they carried were made in the world’s industrial heartland. Today the outlook is different. The world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, is in Dubai. The largest merchant fleets belong to Panama, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands. The world’s manufacturing heartland is in China, Manhattan contends for banking business with the Cayman Islands, and the Met’s collection is rivaled in size by the contents of the Geneva Freeport, a secretive storage facility that will neither confirm nor deny holding any particular artwork. This is what globalization does: it scrambles spaces. Global supply meets global demand, and soon enough you’re eating KFC in Kyrgyzstan. Even so: It’s tiny Panama that has the most merchant ships? The Cayman Islands—three small islands south of Cuba—has one of the world’s largest financial systems? Such circumstances don’t appear to be the outcome of a worldwide hunt for the best labor and resources at the lowest cost. They’re not. Rather, they’re the result of a global search for the most obliging jurisdictions. Hence the Cayman Islands. The small colony hasn’t historically been known for its banks, the first of which opened in a dentist’s office on George Town’s sole paved road in 1953. But Cayman laws exempt foreigners from taxes while fiercely guarding their financial information, making the Caymans a place where money goes to disappear. Such spots have long been the “dirty secrets of modernity,” as the historian Corey Tazzara writes. Swiss bank accounts have concealed fortunes for more than a century. Yet in past decades special zones—compact, designated areas where the normal rules don’t apply—have grown from a marginal to a defining feature of the economy. Capitalism in the age of globalization hasn’t homogenized the world into a flat, monochromatic space, as many once expected. Rather, it has created a patchwork of jurisdictions. The world now contains more than 5,400 economic enclaves: estates, islands, parks, havens, free ports, bonded warehouses, export processing zones, special economic zones, free-trade zones, free points, and the like. One geographer counted eighty-two names for them. As these carve-outs have proliferated, states have struggled to control their own economies. Manufacturing has tumbled from the Global North into the Global South, often lured by the perks of such zones. Wealth, too, slips across borders: perhaps a tenth of global wealth resides in tax havens, many of which are islands or microstates. This is “zonal capitalism,” as the anthropologist Hannah Appel calls it, or “archipelago capitalism,” as the historian Vanessa Ogle does. For years, scholars like the economist Ronen Palan, the anthropologist Aihwa Ong, and the architect Keller Easterling have insisted on the importance of these enclaves and fought against the popular tendency to dismiss them as curiosities.1 It’s been hard to get the public’s sustained attention because there are so many types, under so many names, performing so many functions. Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy, by the historian Quinn Slobodian, draws the scholarship on various types of zones together into a lively, coherent narrative. In doing so, it offers the most powerful case yet that capitalism has acquired a new geography. Slobodian is himself the product of small places. The child of Baha’i missionaries, he grew up on a tiny island off of Vancouver Island, in the enclave country of Lesotho, and on Vanuatu in the South Pacific. And he takes such places seriously. The perforation of large states by thousands of small zones, he believes, is an event of world-historic significance. For market radicals, it’s been a liberation. Although traditionally they’ve dreamed of a borderless world, now they’re seeking an intricately bordered one. “If we want to increase freedom,” the billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel has advised, “we want to increase the number of countries.” The more jurisdictions there are, the thought goes, the easier it is to go sovereignty shopping. For Slobodian, however, this isn’t liberation but “secession.” Corporations and the rich, by channeling their activities into small, exceptional spaces, have escaped the reach of states. The result is a “radical form of capitalism” that evades public accountability—or even scrutiny. An economy of zones, islands, and enclaves also means, Slobodian contends, a “world without democracy.” Advertisement Is capitalism ever compatible with democracy? John Maynard Keynes, arguably the twentieth century’s most important economist, believed so. Keynes hoped to marry the productivity of the market to the politics of liberal democracy. The key, he felt, wasn’t for capitalism to be unleashed or abolished but for it to be “wisely managed,” so that the unruly market could be led to serve a broad public. Led, that is, if politicians could keep hold of the tether. Keynes worried that if capital slipped its leash, it might wreck the welfare state. The wealthy, “constantly taking fright because they think that the degree of leftism in one country looks for the time being likely to be greater than somewhere else,” would send their fortunes scurrying around the map. Mobile wealth wouldn’t just deprive interventionist states of tax revenue; it would destabilize the world economy. To tie global finance down, Keynes sought to regulate it and set stable exchange rates. Such controls, he hoped, would prevent currency trading and long-distance speculation. For free market evangelists like the economist Milton Friedman, Keynesian controls were reckless political interference. Yet midcentury political leaders took Keynes’s side. At the 1945 Bretton Woods Conference, they fixed exchange rates—anchored by the promise that the US dollar could be cashed in for gold at $35 an ounce—and set the stage for extensive capital controls. Keynes marveled that “what used to be a heresy” had become “orthodox.” From today’s perspective the world economic order that Keynes helped create was remarkably constrained. Up through the 1960s, international finance was “rather like a mini-golf course,” observed the economists Fred Hirsch and Peter Oppenheimer. Money could move, but it had to contend with “a variety of shifting obstacles.” Money encountered those obstacles particularly when it crossed borders. This led British bankers to pose a question: What if it never did? In 1957 a sterling crisis impelled the British government to adopt aggressive monetary controls to protect the pound. Seeking a way around these, British bankers started quietly accepting dollar deposits from nonresidents. Because neither the depositors nor the money was British, the accounts could be regarded as existing “offshore.” And if they hadn’t conceptually touched British soil, they weren’t subject to British exchange controls, reserve requirements, or other regulations—or, indeed, to any country’s laws. With this maneuver, bankers carried their clients from the Putt-Putt course to the financial fairway. The Eurodollar market turned the City of London, the UK’s financial center, into an island of freedom in an ocean of regulation—a “Vatican of capitalism,” Slobodian calls it. The City, which had been declining as British power waned, sprang back to life. Bankers accustomed to languorous lunches in mahogany parlors were soon sitting in skyscrapers, devouring sandwiches between long-distance phone calls. In 1959 British and other banks held enough dollars offshore to claim the entirety of US gold reserves. By 1975 they had enough offshore currency—mainly though not exclusively dollars—to match world reserves. Eurodollars formed “the greatest mobile pool of capital in the world,” according to Citibank’s then CEO, Walter Wriston, and if all the dollar holders demanded gold, they’d wreck the US economy. In 1968 President Lyndon Johnson tried to stanch the outflow of dollars by imploring US citizens to stop vacationing in Europe. A congressman proposed using nuclear weapons to unearth more gold. In 1971 President Richard Nixon warned frantically of “international money speculators” waging “an all-out war on the American dollar.” Those speculators won, and in 1973 Nixon broke the bedrock promise that dollars could be traded for gold. This was the central pillar of the agreement at Bretton Woods to manage monetary policy through international cooperation; after it fell, the whole Keynesian system collapsed. Rich countries abandoned their capital controls in the 1970s and 1980s, inaugurating what Wriston called “a galloping new system of international finance.” The end of the gold-convertible dollar is usually taken as the first shot of the free market or neoliberal revolution. It is also, one might add, when the offshore world started colonizing the onshore one. Just as money moved offshore, so did manufacturing. Slobodian identifies Shannon Airport in Ireland as an important precursor to today’s industrial zones. Shannon was where many transatlantic flights refueled, meaning that many passengers traveled through the airport without walking out its doors. But if passengers don’t leave the airport, do they truly enter the country? Or are they offshore? The entrepreneur Brendan O’Regan, seizing on this logic, established the world’s first duty-free shop at Shannon in 1947, selling untaxed bottles of whiskey. When new jet technology in 1958 obviated the need for transatlantic flights to stop, O’Regan proposed enlarging the duty-free area by fencing off a square mile adjacent to the airport and turning it into the “Shannon Free Zone.” Interpreting that land as an extension of the airport, as not quite Ireland, meant exempting it from the country’s substantial economic regulations and transforming it into a haven for manufacturers. From this patch of business-friendly terrain, O’Regan hoped to “pull the airplanes out of the sky.” Advertisement It was an apt metaphor. In the second half of the twentieth century, poor countries struggled to break the colonial economic patterns that consigned them to exporting raw materials and importing finished goods. Prosperity would require wresting lucrative industries away from rich countries—pulling their planes from the sky. What we don’t always appreciate is the extent to which this happened in specially designated enclaves. (Slobodian just calls them all “zones,” no matter their official classifications.) That is especially true in China, which by 2002 accounted for more than two thirds of the 43 million jobs in zones. Chinese premier Deng Xiaoping introduced special economic zones in 1979 as part of his attempt to open the market after Mao Zedong’s death. Taiwan and South Korea had already profitably engaged in Shannon-style experiments. Another model was the British colony of Hong Kong, which, despite its small size, led the world in toy and clothing exports. China started with four zones in the coastal province of Guangdong, most notably Shenzhen, across from Hong Kong. Future Chinese leader Jiang Zemin went to Shannon for three weeks to learn the ropes. Shenzhen was for years surrounded by barbed wire and border guards. Yet inside it was a capitalist oasis where foreign investors enjoyed property rights, tax exemptions, and far greater discretion over employment than elsewhere in China. This made for a strange spectacle. Rather than reversing China’s economic policies, reformers had made spatial exceptions to them, running capitalism and communism simultaneously, like two operating systems on a single computer. (Aihwa Ong calls this the “checkerboard” approach to governing.) The sudden availability of capitalist institutions, combined with a deep reservoir of low-wage Chinese workers, proved explosive. Shenzhen in 1978 was a fishing village without a traffic light; by 2010 it was larger than New York City. Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm that set up shop there, became the world’s largest electronics manufacturer; it now makes iPhones in Shenzhen. Similar zones proliferated across China. “Huge amounts of land were sucked from rural usage and collective ownership,” Slobodian writes, “constituting one of the biggest transfers of public into private wealth in the modern age.” At the same time, “global zone fever” spread through Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Governments now use spatially concentrated investments, incentives, and exemptions to promote livestock processing in Kenya and electric vehicle production in Costa Rica. In 2019 the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development counted 5,400 zones in 147 economies, with more than five hundred more “in the pipeline.” Last year, a global alliance of special economic zones claimed to represent seven thousand zones employing more than 100 million people. Do zones work? The 2019 UNCTAD report cautioned that many underperform, generating only short growth spurts. Critics, meanwhile, note the dangers of suspending the rules for corporate benefit. In 2007, when farmers in West Bengal refused to surrender their land to a zone run by the Salim Group, one of Indonesia’s largest conglomerates, police massacred fourteen of them. Fourteen is also the number of Foxconn workers in Shenzhen who committed suicide in 2010, a grim referendum on the firm’s labor practices. (Foxconn thereafter made its workers sign no-suicide pledges and installed nets to catch them if they jumped off its buildings.) More recently, it’s become clear that funneling large numbers of wage-seeking migrants into compact, loosely regulated areas might not, from an epidemiological perspective, be ideal. Yet whatever credit these zones deserve for it, the migration of industry from historically rich countries to poor ones has been staggering. In 1979 the United States reached a peak of 19.5 million manufacturing jobs; it has since lost a third of them. Meanwhile, in the twenty-five years after China established its first special economic zones, East Asia gained 42 million manufacturing jobs. In 1980 China exported 4 percent of what the United States did. Today it’s the world’s largest exporter, and much of its manufacturing still takes place in zones. Another success story is Dubai, now home to the world’s largest shopping mall and busiest international airport in addition to the Burj Khalifa. As with China, economic zones are at the heart of its rapid transformation. (Dubai’s growth was once oil-driven, but oil now accounts for only one percent of its GDP.) Yet whereas China makes zone-sized exceptions to its laws, in Dubai legal diversity is “the organizing principle for the whole emirate,” Slobodian writes. The emirate is less a nation than a cacophony of small realms—Media City, Academic City, International Humanitarian City, Dubai Design District, Dubai Silicon Oasis—each with its own laws and regulations crafted for its own global constituency. “This,” writes Slobodian, surveying the jumble, “is what the logic of capital looks like.” Or maybe the logic of capital looks like Ugland House, a George Town office in the Cayman Islands that is the registered address for more than 18,000 business entities. Tax havens are of course different from Shenzhen-style zones, but Slobodian points out that they both function as loopholes through which a great deal of wealth flows. Places like the Caymans make money not from taxing businesses but from registration, licensing, and processing fees, which are profitable enough to be a sensible strategy for small countries lacking trade or natural resources. Tellingly, of the countries on the European Union’s tax haven blacklist (which attempts to pressure jurisdictions into complying with international norms), more than four fifths are islands or archipelagoes. And nearly half are, like the Caymans, colonies. This may seem surprising, as the age of empire and the age of the zone haven’t much overlapped: when zones emerged, colonies were mostly disappearing. Yet there is a strong affinity between the two. Empire generates “attenuated, multiplied, and layered” sovereignties, writes Vanessa Ogle, and the rules of the core apply only partly or ambiguously to the periphery.2 Like zones, colonies are spaces of exception. This has made them attractive to those seeking to stash wealth. Ogle describes how wealthy Europeans hastily snatched their assets from decolonizing countries after World War II and shoved them into the few colonies that remained, helping to turn them into full-time tax havens. As a result an enormous amount of money pulses through a network of improbable locations like Bermuda, Nauru, Jersey, Liechtenstein, Malta, Aruba, and the British Virgin Islands. The money eventually makes its way back to centers like New York and London, but by passing through tax havens en route, it shrugs off its cumbersome national origins. How much money? It’s hard to say, given that one of the services tax havens supply is secrecy. Gabriel Zucman, in The Hidden Wealth of Nations, calculates that 8 percent of households’ financial wealth resides in tax havens, a figure the economist Thomas Piketty believes “should be viewed as a lower bound.” One reason Zucman’s figure is low is that not all wealth is financial. On the HBO show Succession, the billionaire Logan Roy is said to own “a shit ton of investment Impressionisms” and “like three Gauguins no one’s seen for tax reasons.” Such art is stored in “free ports,” which were originally stopovers where goods could be held before reaching their destinations and being taxed. By keeping art permanently in free ports, as they have done since the 1990s, shippers can hold it perpetually offshore. Asked the value of the art in the Geneva Freeport—the home of Roy’s fictional Gauguins—a London underwriter replied, “I doubt you’ve got a piece of paper wide enough to write down all the zeros.” Zucman estimates that if you include nonfinancial assets like art, the percentage of global wealth lodged in tax havens rises to 10 or 11. The investigative economist James A. Henry believes it to be two to three times that size. (Zucman doubts this.) Either way, we’re speaking of trillions of dollars. The US government has estimated that it loses $150 billion a year in revenue to tax havens. Google, whose search technologies were invented by graduate students funded by a federal grant, dodged US taxes on those technologies for more than a decade by transferring them to an Irish subsidiary that was legally a resident of Bermuda. Even when they’re not used, the mere existence of such loopholes forces states to treat corporations gently, lest they flee offshore. The price is even higher in the Global South. Whereas some 4 percent of US financial wealth lives offshore, according to Zucman, in Latin America that figure is 22 percent and in Africa it’s 30 percent. The journalist Nicholas Shaxson calculated that in 2006 poor countries lost ten dollars in illicit outflows for every dollar they gained in aid. Much of the Global South suffers from poverty, crime, and corruption—and the ease of hiding money makes all of those problems worse. In 2016 someone anonymously sent reporters 2.6 terabytes of records from a Panamanian law firm. The Panama Papers, as the leak was called, provided evidence of about 214,000 offshore companies. Soon hundreds of journalists interpreting the papers realized how many politicians had close relatives with offshore accounts, including Chinese president Xi Jinping’s brother-in-law, British prime minister David Cameron’s father, and UN secretary-general Kofi Annan’s son. The Russian cellist Sergei Roldugin, godfather to Vladimir Putin’s eldest daughter, was for some mysterious, non-cello-related reason managing $2 billion. Offshore finance made headlines again last year when Sam Bankman-Fried’s cryptocurrency exchange FTX, headquartered in the Bahamas, collapsed. Shaxson has noted how tax havens, with their secrecy and defiance of regulation, invite precisely the risky financial maneuvers that crash economies. Enron, Bernie Madoff, Lehman Brothers, and AIG were “thoroughly entrenched offshore,” he observes in his book Treasure Islands. FTX, it turned out, relied on strategies that would have been illegal in the United States. Most industrial zones are in Asia, Latin America, and Africa; most tax havens are islands in the Caribbean and Pacific. Yet, Slobodian notes, “zones have some of their most ardent supporters in the West.” A major achievement of his book is to present an intellectual history of those champions. Histories of capitalist thought often make much of Milton Friedman, a founding neoliberal who insisted, from the 1950s onward, that economic and political freedoms were linked. By the 1970s, Slobodian observes, Friedman had become fascinated by business-friendly Hong Kong, which he saw as “an almost laboratory experiment in what happens when government is limited to its proper function.” Friedman seemed unbothered that Hong Kong was a colony with few political freedoms. Its promarket institutions, Friedman’s colleague Alvin Rabushka believed, were “made possible by the absence of an electorate.” Hong Kong was also important to Paul Romer, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics. He saw in it a model for charter cities, whose different rules, Romer hoped, could pull the Global South out of poverty. He has been involved with attempts to launch these “start-up political jurisdictions” in Madagascar and Honduras (he’s pitched turning Guantánamo Bay into a charter city, too), though with no success yet. This is a new leaf: starting a city rather than developing a country. Slobodian notes that recent market champions share Silicon Valley’s experimental ethos. Their politics are less insistent (“we must”) and more exploratory (“what if we…?”). “Crossing the river by feeling the stones” is how Deng Xiaoping described China’s economic reforms. This has made it easy to minimize zones as exceptional and tentative. Yet what starts offshore tends to wash up onshore: large countries loosen their laws to compete against tax shelters, or workers migrate to zones hostile to unions, inadvertently undermining labor movements. Zones, it turns out, can transform countries’ politics even without changing their policies. Rather than seek to overthrow governments they dislike, capitalists can “underthrow” them, as the venture capitalist Michael Gibson puts it. Instead of attacking the welfare state, the theory goes, they can play a zone defense, outrun its regulations, and sap its revenues. Slobodian notes how eager the wealthiest today are to “opt out, secede, and defect from the collective.” They live in compounds, fly on private jets, sail superyachts, hoard art in free ports, buy islands, found online worlds, build bunkers, establish alternative currencies, or launch themselves into space. This “plutocratic secession,” as historian Nils Gilman calls it, stems partly from the familiar elite preference for exclusivity, but it’s also ideological. Slobodian points out the leading role of Patri Friedman, Milton’s grandson, in the “seasteading” movement to send forth “aquapreneurs” to colonize the high seas. This is zonal logic taken to its extreme: rather than carve out friendly jurisdictions inside existing states, you build new ones outside of them. Peter Thiel provided the cash to launch Friedman’s Seasteading Institute. “The nature of government,” the billionaire promised, “is about to change at a very fundamental level.” What’s missing from these escape-pod fantasies is the public. “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” Thiel has declared. “The great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms.” The rise of this animus, Slobodian writes, suggests that we’re on track to witness not the “union of capitalism and democracy but their increasing divergence.” Indeed, the age of the zone has also been a new Gilded Age. In hindsight, the Keynesian era, from the 1940s to the 1970s, was a time when states had remarkable success in sharing the fruits of the economy. Since then, governments have retreated from their social functions, workers’ power has declined, and inequality has risen sharply. In rich countries, the wealthiest are paying significantly less in taxes and taking home significantly larger shares of national income than they were in 1980. Zones aren’t the sole cause, but surely they have played a large part by routing economic activity to places where it isn’t taxed or regulated. Was this worth it? Pressed to choose between a bustling market—even an unfair one—and a robust democracy, some would surely prefer the market. This is essentially the bargain that China’s leaders offer to its people: economic gains in exchange for political constraints. Using zones, China has weaned itself off communism, captured manufacturing jobs from richer countries, and grown at a startling speed. Yet many of us wouldn’t cast aside democracy so easily. Government by loophole makes for a cynical society where shared values are transparent fictions and collective action is daunting. It’s hard to know, in a zone-riddled world, how problems requiring coordination and shared sacrifice could be solved. Unfortunately, with climate change and a global pandemic, we are not short on such problems. Capitalism no longer dreams of a unified world. Instead, market radicals have shattered the globe into thousands of zones, enclaves, and special jurisdictions. And they’ve left the rest of us to live among the shards.

            The petrochemical industry is lobbying for “advanced recycling” as a solution to plastic pollution, but a new report reveals a troubling track record at U.S. facilities.           When oil and gas companies first launched their campaign to promote recycling to the American public, they pitched the process as a viable and sustainable solution to the plastic pollution problem. More than three decades later, however, the vast majority of plastic waste still ends up incinerated or dumped, less than one-tenth is recycled, and microplastics have been found virtually everywhere on Earth, including the human bloodstream. The petrochemical industry is now pivoting to another solution: “advanced” recycling. The term, also known as chemical recycling, is used to describe a variety of approaches that can supposedly turn even the most hard-to-recycle plastics into “sustainable” fuels or oils and chemicals that can be used in new plastic production. But a new, 159-page report, released today by Beyond Plastics and the International Pollutants Elimination Network, or IPEN, casts serious doubt on the technology’s ability to make even a modest dent on the world’s growing plastic burden. In the most comprehensive report on chemical recycling facilities in the U.S. to date, researchers looked at the operations of 11 companies across the country to examine the plastic industry’s claim that chemical recycling can significantly help reduce global plastic pollution. “The science and data currently available do not support this claim and actually point to the conclusion that chemical recycling would support expansion of plastic production, while potentially causing unacceptable levels of environmental and social harm — as well as impacts on human health — through emissions, waste generation, energy consumption, and contaminated outputs,” the report’s authors write. Researchers found that, collectively, the 11 facilities have the stated ability to process less than 1.3 percent of America’s annual plastic waste. Additionally, it was unclear if many of the facilities were even operating at their maximum stated capacity. “For a lot of these plants, how much plastic they’ve actually processed is unknown,” Jennifer Congdon, a report contributor and deputy director of Beyond Plastics, told The Intercept. “There’s no requirement for public disclosure.”  The lack of transparency surrounding chemical recycling facilities is especially concerning given the fact that five of the 11 plants have received public subsidies in the form of federal grants, state tax abatements, low-interest green bonds, or government loan guarantees. The Brightmark Energy facility in Ashley, Indiana, for example, has received $4.55 million in grants and tax credits, as well as $185 million in tax-free bonds, according to the report’s findings. However, the plant is still operating in a test phase at one-fiftieth of its publicized capacity, four years after breaking ground. Despite failing to achieve its production targets, Brightmark attempted to expand to Georgia in 2021 to build what would be the nation’s largest chemical recycling plant. The economic development group of Georgia’s Macon-Bibb County inked a tentative deal to provide $500 million in tax-exempt bonds to finance the construction of the plant, contingent on evidence that Brightmark’s Indiana plant was producing and selling product. Brightmark was unable to provide such evidence, and the project was officially killed in April 2022. “The Brightmark example is really important, because they were not even fully operating and trying to expand into Georgia,” said Congdon. “Georgia said, ‘You show us that you’re actually making product and selling it, and then we’ll give you this money.’ That didn’t happen. When they’re being held to account to actually prove that they’re viable, in this case with Brightmark, it just didn’t work.” At the federal level, various incentives exist that could promote the continued expansion of chemical recycling, including the Department of Energy’s $25 million Strategy for Plastic Innovation, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes chemical recycling “approaches” eligible for a $10 billion tax credit program, though the report’s authors note that “it is not clear how such approaches are defined.” “If we’re going to be putting money into projects that are going to address plastic pollution, it should be source reduction strategies,” Congdon said. “I would hope that any public official is doing their due diligence on whether or not they should be using public resources to finance these things. They should actually look into the viability and the pollution before making their choice, and I think the math doesn’t work out.”  Access to public coffers is not the only way the U.S. government has encouraged chemical recycling. Future projects may benefit from a recent spate of state-level laws that have lessened the regulatory burden on so-called advanced recycling. The bills reclassify chemical recycling as manufacturing, which faces less stringent environmental guidelines. The American Chemistry Council, the country’s largest petrochemical industry group, has supported the bills with a lobbying push, claiming that solid waste facility permits are often inapplicable to chemical recycling and the change would simply regulate the facilities more accurately. “There’s an enormous amount of industry-driven hype around chemical recycling and the main reason for that is they don’t want to see legislation at the state or federal level that restricts the production of plastic,” said Lee Bell, policy adviser to IPEN, a network of more than 600 nongovernmental organizations in over 125 countries. “It’s widely agreed that the only way to reduce plastic pollution in a substantive way is to cut production of plastic itself.” Indeed, the United States’ support for chemical recycling appears to be an outlier in the international field. At the 2023 Basel Convention, the leading international decision-making body on the movement and disposal of hazardous waste, delegates rejected the inclusion of chemical recycling in global guidance on plastic waste management. “During the extended negotiations on the matter, over 50 countries objected to the inclusion of chemical recycling in the guidelines on the basis that there was no available independent data to demonstrate that chemical recycling constituted environmentally sound management of plastic waste,” states the Beyond Plastics report. “Despite 50 years of operation of these technologies, no empirical data was presented to demonstrate they met criteria for environmentally sound management.” Bell, who was a member of the Basel Convention Working Group on the technical guidelines for environmentally sound management of plastic waste from 2019 to 2023, provided more background in an email to The Intercept. “The Africa region spoke as a group opposing the inclusion of chemical recycling and they represented 54 countries, mainly on the basis that they did not want to become the destination for these technologies, the hazardous waste they create and the toxic emissions they produce, having already experienced the dumping of other wastes from the global north under the guise of ‘recycling,’” Bell wrote. “They were not alone and several other countries also had serious concerns about the lack of data associated with the industry.” The data that is available about chemical recycling raises serious concerns for public health and environmental risks. A report from the National Resources Defense Council in February 2022 looked at state-level permit data and found that many chemical recycling facilities are permitted to release hazardous air pollutants and “chemicals known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects like birth defects.” The Beyond Plastics report also cites scientific literature that has found “emissions of persistent, cancer-causing compounds from the chemical recycling facilities or their fuel products,” including dioxins, volatile organic compounds, and heavy metals. The authors conducted a 5-mile analysis around each of the 11 plants using the EPA’s Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool, which found that “eight of the plants are located in areas with lower-than-average levels of income, compared to either state or national averages; and seven have higher-than-average concentrations of people of color than the rest of the state and country.” “What data we do have raises red flags about this technology,” said Bell. “If we were to see wide-scale scale-up and build-out, we could foresee very, very significant emission impacts and very little to show for it in terms of recycled plastic production.”

africa neocolonialism continent struggle self sufficiency remain difficult,RT,https://www.rt.com/africa/585928-africa-fight-against-neocolonialism/,africa regional organizations trying overcome legacy neocolonial background read full article rt com,past three years political events mali guinea burkina faso niger attracted international attention raised issue external influence economic community 13110 chars,2023-10-28T12:04:07Z,"Over the past three years, the political events in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Niger have attracted international attention and raised the issue of external influence in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Africa seems to stand on the brink of historical changes as its countries –  both on their own and together– attempt to gain real, not formal, independence and take control over the continent into their own hands. Books published in 2022 and 2023 show that Western scholars have been watching this situation closely, since the West is in no way ready to lose its influence over Africa. “African agency” is one of the most popular modern concepts. It is regularly discussed at conferences related to Africa, as well as in papers and books. Agency is an intangible and multifaceted concept, but one that is crucial for Africa. Moreover, its importance will only increase over the coming years with the expansion of Africa's role in world politics. But what does this mean? Essentially, we’re talking about the sovereignty of African nations and regional organizations, one that would allow African governments to make sovereign decisions independently from non-regional players and to successfully implement them. Theoretical, “superficial” sovereignty no longer deceives anyone, and there is increased social demand in Africa for empirical – in other words, real – sovereignty.  ECOWAS, which was established in 1975, bears many of the 'birth pangs' characteristic of other regional groupings of the Global South and the non-Western world. Take, for example, the issue of extremely low share of intraregional trade: ECOWAS member states account for less than 10% of each other's trade, and less than 5% of the international trade of the group’s leading economy, Nigeria. Does this mean that a single regional market is being formed merely for the convenience of external actors? Most ECOWAS member-countries supply commodities to foreign markets and import finished goods in large quantities because of the poorly-developed local processing industry. Even Nigeria, which is one of the world's largest oil producers, does not have sufficient refinery capacity in order to process its own oil and is forced to import gasoline. This is despite the fact that Nigeria is one of the African countries where the issues of import substitution and industrial development have moved far beyond “good intentions” – many practical steps have been taken to achieve this end.  To be fair, low indicators of internal trade are typical for most non-Western regional groupings. Internal trade in such organizations rarely exceeds 20%, and tops 50% only within the framework of ASEAN +5 (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) as a result of China’s participation. Of course, a large share of domestic trade passes through informal trade channels, but these can hardly ensure the functioning of high-tech industries or modern technological clusters.  In order to form self-sufficient entities in the world economy (the “critical mass” of a nation is not sufficient in this regard) and to effectively develop industrial cooperation, it is necessary to surpass narrow national interests. Currently, only the demographics of Nigeria (with its population of 217 million as of 2022), and perhaps Ghana (with 32.5 million) and Côte d'Ivoire (27.8 million) allow us to discuss a potential domestic market.  Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of independent Ghana (in 1960-1966) and a brilliant visionary, understood this quite well. In the early 1960s, as part of the Casablanca Group and alongside the leaders of Algeria, Guinea, Egypt, Mali, and Morocco he urged to immediately create the Union of African States. However, the President of Tanzania (in 1964-1985) Julius Nyerere, who represented the more moderate Monrovia Group, campaigned for gradual integration that would start at the level of regional associations.  As a result, by the time Africa gained formal independence  – or “flag independence” as Nkrumah called it – the continent was caught up in a powerful disintegration process.  Nyerere eventually admitted that Nkrumah was right. In 1997, he said, “Once you multiply national anthems, national flags and national passports, seats of the United Nations, and individuals entitled to a 21-gun salute, not to speak of a host of ministers, prime ministers and envoys, you would have a whole army of powerful people with vested interests in keeping Africa balkanized.” The interaction between the divided African countries and the world’s largest consolidated geopolitical actor – the European Union, which had absorbed the historical colonial experience of its member-countries –  is clearly asymmetric. Africa’s relations with the EU have moved from the “preferential” format of the Lomé Convention and the Cotonou Agreement to the “equitable” Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) of the post-Cotonou era. Under the Lomé Conventions, African countries were primarily guaranteed that their mineral and agricultural raw materials would be sold on the European market. The transition to EPA tied the national economies to the EU economy in an even closer way, and encouraged the transition to “European standards” not only in the field of economics, but also in socio-political development. In recent years, the trade turnover between ECOWAS and the EU has continued to grow, and surged from 48 billion to 80 billion euros between 2020 and 2022. At this point, the “African agency” issue comes up once again. Formally, since 2017 (the Fifth EU-Africa Summit), political dialogue has been conducted in an European Union-African Union format. However, the real interaction takes place mostly at the regional level, and sometimes even at the country level (which is obviously asymmetrical). Initially, the European Union started EPA negotiations with regional groupings in Africa (including ECOWAS), treating them as single entities. However, it soon became clear that the regional powers which were traditionally set on sovereign development (Nigeria in West Africa, and Tanzania in East Africa), did not want to sign agreements on an unequal footing. Then, utilizing a so-called “twin-track approach”, the EU proceeded to hold individual negotiations (“divide et impera”) with the countries that favored the agreements. Now, could anyone imagine holding separate trade negotiations with individual EU countries?! That’s it. Within ECOWAS, the Trojan horses of the collective West are the “showcases of peripheral capitalism”: Ghana and the Côte d'Ivoire (stepping stone provisional EPAs came into force in 2016), and Kenya in the East African Community (EAC). Although the agreements with West Africa and the EAC are still being finalized and ratified, Africa’s three most conventional countries have long been “enjoying the benefits of civilization.”  This is reminiscent of the capture of Africa by Europeans at the end of the 19th century, when some African nations were still trying to fight the colonizers while others had already integrated into the system. Now, however, we are talking about the collective trade neocolonialism of the 21st century. The “Afrique Occidentale Française” (French West Africa) colonial empire (1895-1958) hasn't existed for a long time, and the former French colonies have gained formal independence. However, France’s monolithic presence, as represented by the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) has not “dissolved” into ECOWAS. Eight of the 15 ECOWAS member-countries have joined this new version of French West Africa, although that accounts for only 22% of the group's GDP. This directly hinders further integration, including on financial and economic levels. Moreover, the artificially-maintained linguistic identity (Francophones vs. Anglophones) still prevails over regional solidarity (West Africans). Once again, we see the 'divide et impera' principle in action! As a part of the collective West headed by the United States and as a sub-imperial power, France has preserved its traditional influence in Africa. It has retained structural power tools such as military interventions (both unilateral and in the format of EU and even UN operations), the CFA franc, the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA), the International Organization of the Francophonie, and the French media. The set of “unequal” treaties between France and African countries (over 200 documents) was imposed on Africa in the first years of its independence, in 1960-1963. It included agreements on defense and the right of residence, cooperation agreements in the fields of foreign trade, economics, finance, technical assistance, and culture, as well as agreements in the fields of justice, transport and telecommunications. In some cases, the transition from colonial tools implying direct control to the same kind of neocolonial tools was clearly superficial. For example, in 1945, the “CFA” franc abbreviation stood for “Colonies Françaises d'Afrique” (French colonies of Africa); from 1958 to the early 1960s, it stood for “Communauté Française d'Afrique” (Franco–African Community), and since 1960s, it means “Communauté Financière Africaine” (African Financial Community). Indeed, why change the name if it’s been used since colonial times? Convenient, isn’t it? On January 20, 1961, the Malian government officially demanded that France evacuate four French military bases which remained stationed in Mali despite the cancellation of mutual defense agreements. By September 1961, the French withdrew from Mali. However, they regained some of their influence during the presidency of Modibo Keita, a trend that continued under Moussa Traoré (e.g., in 1984, Mali readopted the CFA franc) as well as later, in the 1990s.  Yet Clio, the muse of history, is quite ironic. Sixty years later, in February 2022, the government of Mali again demanded that the French withdraw from their military bases, and this was carried out on August 15, 2022. In 2023, the governments of Burkina Faso and Niger also demanded the withdrawal of French troops. Pushing French troops out of the Sahel region actualizes the “Greater Sahel” concept of the French which includes also Cape Verde, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Chad. These are the countries where France hopes to “temporarily” relocate its military and diplomatic forces in anticipation of new “counter-revolutions” in the Sahel. In other words, is France once again saying goodbye, but not going anywhere? More and more countries are building cooperation with non-Western partners. China is already the largest trading partner for over 130 states. The nations of the Global South welcome so-called “non-Western regionalism.” This implies rejecting a one-sided focus on the EU while strengthening their partnership with non-Western regional organizations and increasing the independence of these organizations, including ECOWAS. The Covid-19 pandemic, the Ukrainian conflict, and the growing global competition between the United States and China have all led to so-called “decoupling” – or the formation of closed techno-economic blocs. In Western countries, it is mostly tied to the technology sector, although the concept is gaining momentum among international organizations and in the field of values. The new Cold War is gradually coming into its own. In Africa, the first step is security decoupling, which prompts the countries to choose their priority security partners. Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have already made their choice, preferring strategic alternatives to France. ECOWAS is currently going through interesting times. It has imposed sanctions on four countries (Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, and Niger) that broke away from French neocolonialism and chose to rely on non-Western partners. Russian international lawyers Yao Nikez Adu and Alexander Mezyaev demonstrate how, under the influence of France, ECOWAS leadership sometimes acts in a way that exceeds its authority. Incidentally, Alexander Mezyaev defended Slobodan Milosevic, Ratko Mladic, and Radovan Karadzic in the International Criminal Court (ICC), and is quite familiar with the specifics of the collective West’s “justice” system.  So far, only four out of the 15 ECOWAS member-countries have joined the “wrong side.” The turning point is still far away, but perhaps ECOWAS may be the first regional grouping of the Global South to regain control over its organization. Increasing the agency of Nigerian diplomacy will play a key role on this way. An important sign of such changes is the Nigerian Senate’s refusal of a military intervention in Niger in August 2023. After all, resilient, self-sufficient regional integration groupings in Africa are key to the formation of a multipolar world.

        The EU’s Ports Strategy proposes measures to intercept drugs and other illicit goods on arrival in Europe, but disrupting global black market hubs will have a far greater impact, David M Luna writes.
     Europe's major ports have served as global trade gateways for decades, ushering in an era of unparalleled wealth and economic expansion for the continent.  Yet, unfortunately, these gateways have also facilitated the influx of illicit goods and contraband — from dangerous illegal drugs and weapons to counterfeit vehicle parts, pesticides, cigarettes and pharmaceuticals — posing a huge challenge to the public security of European governments and the EU at large. As the European Commission unveiled its ambitious strategy to combat drug trafficking within Europe's ports, it was no surprise that Rotterdam and Antwerp were identified as major pathways for an array of illicit products.  “Criminals use logistic hubs in the EU and non-EU countries to carry out their illegal activities,” the European Commission’s roadmap to build the European Ports Alliance warned. In the meantime, Experts tracking illicit trade patterns at the International Coalition Against Illicit Economies (ICAIE) and strategic evidence-based research at Terrorism, Transatlantic Crime and Corruption Center (TraCCC) have zeroed in on the issue in a new report.  Its conclusions highlight at least four ""hubs of illicit trade"" which act as significant global logistics and distribution conduits for illegal trade and related money laundering that help finance greater criminality and terrorism. Panama and the UAE, two of the hubs of illicit trade highlighted in the TraCCC-AITI report, stand out as two of the most problematic from the European perspective.  Astonishingly, almost 2 million containers — 58 million tonnes of goods — make their way from Dubai's Free Trade Zones (FTZs) to the EU each year, with an additional 500,000 originating from FTZs in Panama. Rotterdam and Antwerp are the biggest entry points, handling 30% of the total traffic. In October 2023, the MV Matthew, a ship loaded with two tonnes of pure cocaine, was seized off the coast of Ireland following a pan-European operation.  Flying the flag of Panama, but with a website registered in Dubai, the ship attempted to deliver illegal drugs — valued at nearly €200 million, to Europe from Guyana.  The lack of financial regulation in these jurisdictions, combined with the lack of scrutiny and enforcement of laws in FTZs is what attracts criminal entrepreneurs and illicit networks to export their criminality. The Free Trade ports in Dubai are the point of origin for illicit cigarettes smuggled across the so-called “Maghreb route,” which connects countries in the Middle East and northwestern Africa with Europe.  These and other illicit products find their way through North Africa to France, Italy, and Spain.  Every year, billions of cigarettes come to Europe through this route, siphoning billions of euros of tax revenue from governments. Alarming as it is, Europol reports that just 2% of containers arriving in Europe's ports are searched by authorities. This means that only a fraction of the illegal products entering Europe can ever be successfully seized.  In this context, the EU’s Ports Strategy would benefit from paying particular attention to the cross-border flow of illegal and counterfeit products arriving in Europe from Dubai, Panama, and other identified ""hubs"" and illicit routes focused in our TraCCC-AITI report. While the EU Ports Strategy is poised to enhance technological collaboration and bolster authorities' abilities to intercept illegal shipments, the most meaningful interventions in the global black market would be to disrupt these ""hubs of illicit trade"" through intelligence-sharing across borders. Meaningful action to clamp down on Free Trade Zones will have a far greater impact in stopping illegal and counterfeit products from reaching Europe, and strengthening collective security across global markets and supply chains including the effective implementation of the OECD “Recommendation on Countering Illicit Trade: Enhancing Transparency in Free Trade Zones”.  Through dynamic public-private partnerships, critical market stakeholders must work together with the UAE, Panama, and other countries to promote cleaner trade and to counter illicit trade around the world.

BRICS currently comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, but will be joined by Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE this coming January. The decision to accept the new members was made during the group’s August summit in Johannesburg. According to analyst estimates, the expanded group will represent nearly half of global output by 2040, doubling the share of the Group of Seven (G7), which consists of the US, Canada, UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that BRICS already outpaced the G7 states in terms of the purchasing power parity (PPP) of their populations. Experts project the combined gross domestic product (GDP) of the expanded BRICS in terms of PPP to amount to roughly $65 trillion. This would push the group’s share of global GDP up from the current 31.5% to 37%. In comparison, the share of the G7 is currently around 29.9%. BRICS was originally ‘BRIC’, a term coined by economists using the first letter of four nations – Brazil, Russia, India, and China – that were seen as having the potential to dominate the world economy in the 21st century. These countries first came together in 2006 and later welcomed South Africa as a new member, adding the letter ‘S’ to the acronym.  Originally formed largely for the purpose of highlighting investment opportunities among members, the group has become instrumental in building a new “multipolar” world order that will help give a stronger voice to the Global South.  In 2014, the BRICS group launched its own international lender, the New Development Bank (NDB), which was seen as an alternative to US-dominated financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. It provides funding for infrastructure and sustainable development projects.  The bank formally opened for business in 2015, and was later joined by Bangladesh, the UAE, Egypt, and Uruguay.

     This work is part of the project Peace Positive Private Sector Development in Africa (P3A), funded by the Research Council of Norway. Additional funding was received from the Peace Finance Initiative.  Stellenbosch University provides funding as a partner of The Conversation AFRICA. View all partners To what extent does private investment help developing countries to reduce conflict and violence and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals?  This is a hotly debated issue. Most international institutions such as the World Bank Group take the stance that the problem is not enough private investment. So they mobilise public resources to subsidise and protect private sector actors with the goal of greatly increasing foreign direct investment.  Meanwhile, community, labour and human rights advocates – particularly in fragile and conflict-affected countries – tend instead to see the dominant patterns of foreign direct investment as part of a continuing history of exploitation of the developing world. To help shed light on this debate, we undertook a comprehensive study of thousands of projects of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group. We focused on the period between 1994 and 2022.  We chose the IFC because it claims to invest with developmental purpose. It also purports to apply the highest standards of social and environmental performance. Additionally, many other private and public actors follow its lead in setting standards. If the IFC is getting it wrong it would be a good indicator of how things stand in the broader global system. We focused our study on the relationship between IFC projects and armed conflict, as violence has a clear and detrimental effect on human development.  The results establish that IFC projects cause significant increases in armed conflict around the world. A single project, on average, causes 7.6 additional armed conflict events in the year after it is introduced. These findings are consistent with other large quantitative studies that question the relationship between foreign direct investment and development. Foreign direct investment that increases violent conflict and makes development nearly impossible appears the rule, not the exception. We conclude that current approaches to foreign investment need urgent reconsideration, with particular focus on the risk of violent conflict. Many factors influence violent conflict, including the history of intergroup and state-society relations. So the study used sophisticated econometric analyses to isolate the IFC’s impact.  We first geolocated IFC projects and noted the years in which they were approved. Then we tested whether armed conflict rose in the area proximate to the IFC project in the following year. We controlled for other factors – such as the presence of politically excluded groups, GDP, the regime type, or the population size – that affect conflict.  In the analysis, we were careful to match and compare an IFC project area with those areas without IFC projects to which it is most similar. Finally, we considered and controlled for the possibility that conflict was already rising before the IFC project arrived. By excluding these other explanations for conflict events, we were able to make reasonable causal attributions.

      Three priorities Africa's newbie on the World Bank board should focus on


 Disturbingly, the study found that increases in armed conflict were concentrated in projects that the IFC told local and international stakeholders had potential limited adverse environmental or social risks. It claimed that these could be readily addressed through mitigation measures. These mitigation measures appear to be either ineffective or under-employed. Alternatively, the IFC is mis-classifying projects that carry more substantial conflict risk than it recognises or cares to make public. One particularly disturbing example is the Ugandan government’s campaign of terror against local citizens to turn land over to an IFC client. The IFC also has yet to resolve activists’ complaints from 2019 of gender-based violence and threats of reprisals and intimidation against one of its project partners, Salala Rubber Corporation in Liberia. The study also demonstrated that capital-intensive projects (that is, agribusiness, oil, gas, mining and infrastructure) have a larger propensity for socio-political and socio-economic disruption. Areas that receive capital-intensive projects experience, on average, an additional death from armed conflict in the following year. These results should perhaps not be surprising. Civil society groups have long concluded that the IFC prioritises its own profits and business interests over the “suffering of others” in ways that contribute to “multiple paths of extraction, dispossession, and conflict”. In 2020 Human Rights Watch characterised the IFC as “failing at remedies for project abuses”. This was based on the World Bank Group’s own commissioned review.

      Cautious welcome: World Bank and IMF return to Africa, but questions remain


 Yet, the IFC’s strategy has been to position itself above the rule of law. It continues to assert sovereign immunity. It claims that, as an international organisation, it should not be liable in national courts – even to parties it admittedly harms.  It maintains this stance despite recent reports of IFC complicity in covering up the sexual abuse of children to further its investment projects.  It appears beyond time for the 186 member governments that own the IFC to demand transparency, accountability and redress for harms done from the corporation and the private sector actors it funds. Others can also play a role. Governments that have perhaps naively relied on the World Bank halo should question the benefits they are told they can expect from IFC investments. The ratings agencies that classify IFC bonds as positive from an environmental, social, and governance perspective may want to question the bases on which such determinations are made. At the same time, perhaps more credence can be given to recent calls by the UN secretary general to reform the global financial system to better support human security and human development.  This could include specialised intermediaries between the IFC and sensitive projects in difficult places. Independent and empowered local oversight appears necessary to ensure more inclusive and accountable forms of contextual analysis and risk mitigation planning, monitoring and evaluation of development impact, proactive conflict management, and accessible redress for harms done. This could reduce violent conflict and open more developmental potential for private investment in the developing world.","a single project causes 7.6 additional armed conflict events in the year after it is introduced. a single project, on average, causes 7.6 additional armed conflict events in the year after it is introduced.",neutral,Environment,Technology,Technology,2

oil could hit 120 next year fitch ratings,RT,https://www.rt.com/business/587161-oil-price-growth-middle-east-conflict/,oil price shock could weigh global economic growth 2024 push inflation fitch ratings warned read full article rt com,conflict middle east threatens disrupt oil supply subsequently hurt global economic growth 2024 fitch ratings warned report friday agency outlined poten 1909 chars,2023-11-13T12:12:16Z,"The conflict in the Middle East threatens to disrupt the oil supply and subsequently hurt global economic growth in 2024, Fitch Ratings has warned. In a report on Friday, the agency outlined a potential scenario with higher-than-expected oil prices, which is expected to curb world GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points next year. Fitch's previous forecast suggested that oil would average $75 per barrel in 2024 and $70 in 2025. However, the conflict in the Middle East has changed all that. “Our scenario assumes that, due to supply restrictions, oil prices average $120/bbl in 2024 and $100/bbl in 2025,” it added. “Higher oil prices would dampen GDP growth in almost all the Fitch 20 (economies it forecasts), although the impact would largely dissipate in 2025,” Fitch wrote, noting that growth in the US, the Eurozone and Japan would ebb 0.5 percentage points in 2024. It also assumed that the largest impacts among the main emerging market countries would be in South Africa and Türkiye. “Russia, and to a much lesser extent Brazil, would see a positive impact due to the important role of oil production in these economies,” the report noted. Higher oil prices would lead to higher-than-expected inflation rates in 2024, followed by corrections in 2025, according to the ratings agency. The inflation impact would be short-lived and partly offset by lower-than-forecast inflation rates in 2025. “An oil price shock related to the Middle East conflict could be accompanied by tighter financial conditions, lower business and consumer confidence, and corrections in financial markets,” Fitch concluded. The Middle East found itself in the throes of renewed violence on October 7, when the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing over 1,200 people. Israel’s retaliatory bombardment of Gaza has led to over 10,000 deaths so far, according to Palestinian authorities. The biggest threat to the global economy comes from the potential of the conflict spreading to other countries in the region.

The Kimberley Process is a global trade regime established two decades ago with the aim of increasing transparency and oversight in the diamond supply chain and eliminating trade in conflict diamonds. Meanwhile, bin Sulayem, who was elected this week to head up the multilateral regulatory body, told the FT on Tuesday that any proposed scheme “must take into account African diamond producing nations” such as Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Africa. However, the EU proposal to put restrictions on the global trade of diamonds, which could be adopted by the G7, “falls well short of this important goal,” he said. The report follows EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell’s statement last week that the bloc was set to move ahead with a ban on Russian diamonds after receiving sufficient backing from the G7. According to the FT, one version of the proposal entails Antwerp becoming a “gatekeeper” to ensure the non-Russian origin of diamonds entering the market of G7 nations. Sulayem pointed to growing concern among African nations that they could become collateral damage under such a proposal, while Antwerp is set to profit from their diamonds. They have also been complaining about not being invited to the G7 discussions, he said. The African Diamond Producers Association warned last month that the proposal would “bring supply chain disruption [and] added burden and costs” to mining nations. The association represents 19 producers accounting for 60% of global output. Imports of rough diamonds from Russia were either banned or partially restricted by the US, UK, Canada, and New Zealand last year. The G7 and EU have been considering a broader ban over the past several months that would restrict direct purchases of diamonds from Russia and introduce a mechanism to prevent indirect imports of rough gems of Russian origin. According to media reports, the countries plan to introduce a special tracking system that would include physical checks of packages containing stones, and compulsory traceability data for diamond producers and traders.

AVZ initially held the rights to develop the lithium-rich area in the southeastern DRC town of Manono since 2017, when it formed a joint venture between its unit, Dathcom Mining SA, and local state-owned miner La Congolaise d’Exploitation Miniere (Cominiere). However, AVZ’s permit was revoked by the Congolese Ministry of Mines in February this year on grounds that the company had not developed the site fast enough. Last week, China’s top gold and copper miner, Zijin Mining Group, announced its own joint venture with Cominiere to develop part of the site. The company said the Congolese authorities granted it rights over the northeast tenement of the Manono mine, with Zijin’s Jinxiang Lithium unit holding 61% of the project and Cominiere holding the rest. Australia’s AVZ argues that it owns the entire site, including the area covered by the new permit. “The Company, via its subsidiaries, has resolved to file an emergency arbitration application… seeking injunctive relief against Cominiere to enjoin the state owned company from conducting, directly or indirectly, any transaction regarding [the Manono mine],” AVZ said in a statement. The company expects its application, which it plans to file in the International Criminal Court, to pause the transaction of the development rights to Zijin. Zijin last week said it will defend its right to advance the lithium project. AVZ already has pending legal proceedings against both Cominiere and another unit of Zijin, all revolving around the Manono site. Africa is rapidly becoming a battleground among global powers competing in clean energy solutions. China has become an active player in the continent’s resource market, with existing and planned investments ranging from copper to cobalt, lithium, and nickel, metals vital for renewable power and electric cars production. However, other countries have been pursuing similar interests on the continent, including the US. Earlier this month, reports emerged that Washington is seeking to block Beijing’s bid in the planned sale of mining group Chemaf Resources, which operates copper and cobalt mines in the DRC.

The minister stressed that Indonesia has always aspired to pursue an independent foreign policy. He emphasized that the country’s economy greatly depends on trade, which makes it crucial that any political decisions are guided first and foremost by economic interests.

What are fond memories of your childhood?
I’m Oluwatosin Olaseinde, founder of Money Africa. I’m from a family of five. I studied at Queens College, Yaba, Lagos. At the age of 16, my family travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo. We lived there for about two years before we moved to South Africa where I obtained my A-Levels, first and second degrees. I also worked in South Africa for a while. In total, I lived in South Africa for about 10 years before moving back to Nigeria. I’m a young person passionate about finance and I’m playing a key role in personal finance in Africa.
When did you decide to become an entrepreneur and what drove that desire? 
After my A-Levels in South Africa, I taught children in secondary school accounting and it’s so funny how it all panned out. My sister then was about 10 years old and she was attending a school called Jeppe Primary School, Johannesburg, in South Africa. I used to wake up in the morning, print out fliers, and hand the fliers to parents in their cars for those looking for accounting tutors. That was where I started acquiring my first juices. It was just a side hobby then, really, I just wanted to get extra income, and then lo and behold, here I am doing it on a bigger scale, but I was just doing it.
Where did you learn that from?
Well, my parents. My father was an astute entrepreneur when I was a child. He went to the DR Congo, where he didn’t even understand the language of the people who spoke French and Lingala, but he went there and built a couple of businesses. He built businesses in Congo, South Africa, and Nigeria. So, it’s my parents. My dad must have picked my interest in entrepreneurship.      
Growing up was interesting. I’ll say that my father has been instrumental in our lives; he’s a dreamer and we picked up that dream from him. My mum is a very sweet and kind mother who sells me hope, joy, and love. It’s just been a blessing being children of these amazing people. In terms of my siblings, my sister and I are super close. She’s like a super rock and almost like a business partner because we work together, and we understand each other. So, growing up being the child of my parents having fantastic siblings has been insightful and interesting.
 How did you establish Money Africa?
After I was done in South Africa, I relocated back home to Nigeria and I got my first job with CNBC Africa in Lagos but something interesting happened. Although I have two degrees in finance and worked for about four years in Finance in South Africa, when I came back to Nigeria, I was broke. I was living from hand to mouth in South Africa despite having a decent income; I didn’t apply any of my personal finance knowledge. Also, the only car I had which I was thinking about selling and then bringing the money back to Nigeria, got stolen and the car didn’t have insurance. So, I came back to Nigeria broke. I remember being in church and my mum squeezed N500 into my hand as an offering and that day, I cried. That was the day I told myself that I never wanted that to happen again. So, I had to start teaching myself about personal finance.
At that time, there was no one place where one could learn about finance; it was disjointed. So, I learnt in a couple of places. Thus, I taught myself about money and moved from CNBC Africa to Bloomberg TV Africa, and from there I worked with British American Tobacco as a commercial finance manager. When I turned 30, I knew it was time and I started my own business. At the same time, I had just started teaching people about money on social media. That was how it started and it blew up in my face. In six months, we had about 20,000 followers and I knew that it was time to take it to the next level and that was how Money Africa started that year (in 2018). So, we applied technology, had courses set on the website, had a subscription module, and all of that. However, on the journey of building Money Africa, people always ask us one question: How can I invest? That was what gave birth to Ladda NG, a one-stop financial platform where you can invest; we also started putting considerations because the way a 21-year-old would invest is different from the way a 40-year-old would invest. That’s the advisory arm of the business where you’re able to identify people’s unique situations and guide them to the right investment. So, that was how we built Ladda. It was also borne out of the passion for personal finance. Now, we have savings, and investments, among others.
You’re a chartered accountant with over 10 years of experience. How would you describe your experience as an entrepreneur?
To be honest, there are high days and there are low days. I wouldn’t say it is a rollercoaster but nothing is guaranteed, really. You just have to continue to build. However, one thing that has been helpful is that we see business as a long-term plan. So, you’re not obsessed about a year but you’re thinking about a decade. So, we are thinking about how we will build for the next 10 years, build for the next 20 years, and build a business that we can pass on to the next generation. That sort of gives a relief such that whenever things happen, you’re not too bothered or extremely worried or too shaken.
You noted that you attended school in South Africa. How did your academic journey go?        
My educational journey was quite an experience. During my secondary education at Queens College, Yaba, Lagos, I met amazing people who are still friends with me today. I enjoyed it. Then onto South Africa at Greenwich College where I completed my A levels. I took Mathematics but I can’t remember the second subject. I remember when I was taking my A-levels, the first course I chose was actuarial science and I was rejected; I wasn’t taken and I went for accounting. However, accounting has been interesting and it’s amazing what understanding numbers can do. Then, I studied for my first degree at the University of Johannesburg and then I got my second degree in Accounting at the University of South Africa. After that, I took my exams to qualify as a chartered accountant. So, that was my journey. I’ve been in finance and accounting for over a decade. I started my first job at the age of 20 and I have over a decade of practice.
How do you think technology will close the gaps in Nigeria’s financial sector? 
It will reach places that we cannot imagine. It will bank the unbanked. It will make things accessible, reduce costs, and make services available such that certain services can be reached by people who are presently locked out of the system. So, whether we like it or not, technology is here to stay. Technology is a game changer and the question should be how we want to use technology, how people will access technology, and how we will reward them. Let me give an instance. We want people to bank online and if the cost of accessing that service online is expensive, they’ll just stick to the traditional method. So, we have to make it a win-win situation for everyone for technology to be able to scale. For me, I love the fact that technology significantly reduces costs. For example, let’s look at the banking sector. Instead of having a branch in all vicinity and all of that, how can we leverage tech to cut that and instead make it easier and accessible for people? Look at the insurance sector; insurance penetration is just three per cent and we can do way more. The technological advantage can help us increase the penetration to 10 per cent, 20 per cent, and even more. We can leverage tech to make that happen. We should be asking ourselves how to sell insurance as if we are selling groceries.
Do you consider yourself a big dreamer and goal-getter as a young lady?
When Amazon became a trillionaire company, they said this was just the beginning. Imagine Amazon, a company worth trillions saying it was just the beginning. So, this is just the start of my career also. We’ve not even scratched the surface yet.
Which of your career achievements do you consider as memorable?
In terms of my career highlight, it was when the Nigerian Stock Exchange recognised our work in financial inclusion and literacy; that was huge. The stock market of a $33trn dollar company recognising your work is huge. That was very helpful because when the stock market of the country with the largest gross domestic product in Africa recognised my work.      
Which among the decisions you took reshaped you and your career?
I don’t think there was one decision; I just think it was a compilation of multiple small decisions that did it for me – my father’s role in encouraging me, getting a degree in finance, working in finance, being broke, and wanting to do better with my own money. All these experiences, my working experiences, picking up my phone to open an Instagram page to teach people about personal finance, and every other step in the process helped me.  Related News

Have you been discriminated against or looked down upon based on age or gender?
Discrimination is very subjective and I wouldn’t use the word discrimination but I remember when we were fundraising for Ladda NG and considering the work we had done, it was difficult and probably if I were a man, it would have been easier to raise funds. Then the question they tended to ask me during the fundraiser was about what we had done. Research stated that when women are raising, they ask them more about what they have done as opposed to when they’re interviewing male founders when they are more futuristic.
In a world where women face different challenges, where do you think many women can find strengths?
I think on the financial part, it is good to leverage what you are good at. A lot of people will tell you to work on your weaknesses but I think you should double down on your strengths, and work hard on your strengths. That gives you a competitive advantage; you already have an edge.
What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?  
Well, I believe that as long as you have life, there’s hope. So, if you can stay alive long enough, you can see magic happen. So, continue doing what you’re doing, and stay resilient and optimistic. Also, it is important to know when to stop when something isn’t working, it is good to know when to stop.
Not much is available to the public about your relationship. Are you married?
No, I’m not married.
As a successful woman, how do you deal with the attention you get from men?
I will not want to answer that.
What was the motive behind Money Africa Kids, what’s it about?
During the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a lockdown and the children were home, I thought about what we do to make children learn while they were at home. So, when parents or adults came to us to learn about money, their comments were always that they wished that they knew this when they were at a young age. Based on research, at the age of seven, your mindset about money has been formed and this can be from what your parents say about money, what they do with money, and how they behave towards money. So, we decided to go after the kids. We started having summer boot camps where we taught children online about money. We educated them and before we knew it, we said we did not want to teach them during summer alone, we wanted a product that would teach them all year long and that was how we launched Money Africa Kids. It’s a financial literacy platform for children where we teach them about money and other financial knowledge like budgeting, investing, the stock market, and many other things and I’m very excited about it.      
Why do you think kids should be financially literate before coming of age?
It helps them and it saves them time. Many people are in their 30s and sometimes in their 40s before they start knowing what financial literacy is. So, we can give them a head start. Time plays a critical role in investing and the earlier you start learning about it, the better. We want to catch them young and engrave it in their mindset so that when they start making money, they have an edge over their peers and other adults or people who do not have that knowledge.
Is it correct to say you started Money Africa Kids to help children acquire financial knowledge you lacked when you were a kid?
Yes, due to the financial knowledge I lacked but most importantly it was a running thing. Also, the educational system does not capture that and we also wanted to bridge that gap.
What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your bid to reduce financial illiteracy in Africa?
The biggest challenge we have to face is scaling. It’s one to go from zero to one and it’s another thing entirely to go from one to 10. We are currently at that point of hacking scale and we are facing challenges such as distribution, language barrier, trust in the system (which is a big one), and changing mindset from short term to long term which goes back again to the trust deficit highlighted in the previous one. I think I will sit back and start relaxing once we’ve reached at least 10 million Africans.
How do you find a balance between your work life and your social life?        
I try to inculcate a work-life balance. I love to engage in other curricular activities. I am quite intentional about nourishing other areas of my life in balance with work.
What is your drive?
I want to see a financially literate Africa. Based on research, financial literacy in Africa is low. So, we want to bridge that gap for Africans and teach people financial literacy in indigenous languages. That’s our big dream.
                                             What are fond memories of your childhood?
I’m Oluwatosin Olaseinde, founder of Money Africa. I’m from a family of five. I studied at Queens College, Yaba, Lagos. At the age of 16, my family travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo. We lived there for about two years before we moved to South Africa where I obtained my A-Levels, first and second degrees. I also worked in South Africa for a while. In total, I lived in South Africa for about 10 years before moving back to Nigeria. I’m a young person passionate about finance and I’m playing a key role in personal finance in Africa.
When did you decide to become an entrepreneur and what drove that desire? 
After my A-Levels in South Africa, I taught children in secondary school accounting and it’s so funny how it all panned out. My sister then was about 10 years old and she was attending a school called Jeppe Primary School, Johannesburg, in South Africa. I used to wake up in the morning, print out fliers, and hand the fliers to parents in their cars for those looking for accounting tutors. That was where I started acquiring my first juices. It was just a side hobby then, really, I just wanted to get extra income, and then lo and behold, here I am doing it on a bigger scale, but I was just doing it.
Where did you learn that from?
Well, my parents. My father was an astute entrepreneur when I was a child. He went to the DR Congo, where he didn’t even understand the language of the people who spoke French and Lingala, but he went there and built a couple of businesses. He built businesses in Congo, South Africa, and Nigeria. So, it’s my parents. My dad must have picked my interest in entrepreneurship.      
Growing up was interesting. I’ll say that my father has been instrumental in our lives; he’s a dreamer and we picked up that dream from him. My mum is a very sweet and kind mother who sells me hope, joy, and love. It’s just been a blessing being children of these amazing people. In terms of my siblings, my sister and I are super close. She’s like a super rock and almost like a business partner because we work together, and we understand each other. So, growing up being the child of my parents having fantastic siblings has been insightful and interesting.
 How did you establish Money Africa?
After I was done in South Africa, I relocated back home to Nigeria and I got my first job with CNBC Africa in Lagos but something interesting happened. Although I have two degrees in finance and worked for about four years in Finance in South Africa, when I came back to Nigeria, I was broke. I was living from hand to mouth in South Africa despite having a decent income; I didn’t apply any of my personal finance knowledge. Also, the only car I had which I was thinking about selling and then bringing the money back to Nigeria, got stolen and the car didn’t have insurance. So, I came back to Nigeria broke. I remember being in church and my mum squeezed N500 into my hand as an offering and that day, I cried. That was the day I told myself that I never wanted that to happen again. So, I had to start teaching myself about personal finance.
At that time, there was no one place where one could learn about finance; it was disjointed. So, I learnt in a couple of places. Thus, I taught myself about money and moved from CNBC Africa to Bloomberg TV Africa, and from there I worked with British American Tobacco as a commercial finance manager. When I turned 30, I knew it was time and I started my own business. At the same time, I had just started teaching people about money on social media. That was how it started and it blew up in my face. In six months, we had about 20,000 followers and I knew that it was time to take it to the next level and that was how Money Africa started that year (in 2018). So, we applied technology, had courses set on the website, had a subscription module, and all of that. However, on the journey of building Money Africa, people always ask us one question: How can I invest? That was what gave birth to Ladda NG, a one-stop financial platform where you can invest; we also started putting considerations because the way a 21-year-old would invest is different from the way a 40-year-old would invest. That’s the advisory arm of the business where you’re able to identify people’s unique situations and guide them to the right investment. So, that was how we built Ladda. It was also borne out of the passion for personal finance. Now, we have savings, and investments, among others.

So, we are thinking about how we will build for the next 10 years, build for the next 20 years, and build a business that we can pass on to the next generation. That sort of gives a relief such that whenever things happen, you’re not too bothered or extremely worried or too shaken.

I will not want to answer that.
What was the motive behind Money Africa Kids, what’s it about?
During the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a lockdown and the children were home, I thought about what we do to make children learn while they were at home. So, when parents or adults came to us to learn about money, their comments were always that they wished that they knew this when they were at a young age. Based on research, at the age of seven, your mindset about money has been formed and this can be from what your parents say about money, what they do with money, and how they behave towards money. So, we decided to go after the kids. We started having summer boot camps where we taught children online about money. We educated them and before we knew it, we said we did not want to teach them during summer alone, we wanted a product that would teach them all year long and that was how we launched Money Africa Kids. It’s a financial literacy platform for children where we teach them about money and other financial knowledge like budgeting, investing, the stock market, and many other things and I’m very excited about it.      
Why do you think kids should be financially literate before coming of age?
It helps them and it saves them time. Many people are in their 30s and sometimes in their 40s before they start knowing what financial literacy is. So, we can give them a head start. Time plays a critical role in investing and the earlier you start learning about it, the better. We want to catch them young and engrave it in their mindset so that when they start making money, they have an edge over their peers and other adults or people who do not have that knowledge.
Is it correct to say you started Money Africa Kids to help children acquire financial knowledge you lacked when you were a kid?
Yes, due to the financial knowledge I lacked but most importantly it was a running thing. Also, the educational system does not capture that and we also wanted to bridge that gap.
What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your bid to reduce financial illiteracy in Africa?
The biggest challenge we have to face is scaling. It’s one to go from zero to one and it’s another thing entirely to go from one to 10. We are currently at that point of hacking scale and we are facing challenges such as distribution, language barrier, trust in the system (which is a big one), and changing mindset from short term to long term which goes back again to the trust deficit highlighted in the previous one. I think I will sit back and start relaxing once we’ve reached at least 10 million Africans.
How do you find a balance between your work life and your social life?        
I try to inculcate a work-life balance. I love to engage in other curricular activities. I am quite intentional about nourishing other areas of my life in balance with work.
What is your drive?
I want to see a financially literate Africa. Based on research, financial literacy in Africa is low. So, we want to bridge that gap for Africans and teach people financial literacy in indigenous languages. That’s our big dream.
                                             When did you decide to become an entrepreneur and what drove that desire? 
After my A-Levels in South Africa, I taught children in secondary school accounting and it’s so funny how it all panned out. My sister then was about 10 years old and she was attending a school called Jeppe Primary School, Johannesburg, in South Africa. I used to wake up in the morning, print out fliers, and hand the fliers to parents in their cars for those looking for accounting tutors. That was where I started acquiring my first juices. It was just a side hobby then, really, I just wanted to get extra income, and then lo and behold, here I am doing it on a bigger scale, but I was just doing it.
Where did you learn that from?
Well, my parents. My father was an astute entrepreneur when I was a child. He went to the DR Congo, where he didn’t even understand the language of the people who spoke French and Lingala, but he went there and built a couple of businesses. He built businesses in Congo, South Africa, and Nigeria. So, it’s my parents. My dad must have picked my interest in entrepreneurship.      
Growing up was interesting. I’ll say that my father has been instrumental in our lives; he’s a dreamer and we picked up that dream from him. My mum is a very sweet and kind mother who sells me hope, joy, and love. It’s just been a blessing being children of these amazing people. In terms of my siblings, my sister and I are super close. She’s like a super rock and almost like a business partner because we work together, and we understand each other. So, growing up being the child of my parents having fantastic siblings has been insightful and interesting.
 How did you establish Money Africa?
After I was done in South Africa, I relocated back home to Nigeria and I got my first job with CNBC Africa in Lagos but something interesting happened. Although I have two degrees in finance and worked for about four years in Finance in South Africa, when I came back to Nigeria, I was broke. I was living from hand to mouth in South Africa despite having a decent income; I didn’t apply any of my personal finance knowledge. Also, the only car I had which I was thinking about selling and then bringing the money back to Nigeria, got stolen and the car didn’t have insurance. So, I came back to Nigeria broke. I remember being in church and my mum squeezed N500 into my hand as an offering and that day, I cried. That was the day I told myself that I never wanted that to happen again. So, I had to start teaching myself about personal finance.
At that time, there was no one place where one could learn about finance; it was disjointed. So, I learnt in a couple of places. Thus, I taught myself about money and moved from CNBC Africa to Bloomberg TV Africa, and from there I worked with British American Tobacco as a commercial finance manager. When I turned 30, I knew it was time and I started my own business. At the same time, I had just started teaching people about money on social media. That was how it started and it blew up in my face. In six months, we had about 20,000 followers and I knew that it was time to take it to the next level and that was how Money Africa started that year (in 2018). So, we applied technology, had courses set on the website, had a subscription module, and all of that. However, on the journey of building Money Africa, people always ask us one question: How can I invest? That was what gave birth to Ladda NG, a one-stop financial platform where you can invest; we also started putting considerations because the way a 21-year-old would invest is different from the way a 40-year-old would invest. That’s the advisory arm of the business where you’re able to identify people’s unique situations and guide them to the right investment. So, that was how we built Ladda. It was also borne out of the passion for personal finance. Now, we have savings, and investments, among others.
You’re a chartered accountant with over 10 years of experience. How would you describe your experience as an entrepreneur?
To be honest, there are high days and there are low days. I wouldn’t say it is a rollercoaster but nothing is guaranteed, really. You just have to continue to build. However, one thing that has been helpful is that we see business as a long-term plan. So, you’re not obsessed about a year but you’re thinking about a decade. So, we are thinking about how we will build for the next 10 years, build for the next 20 years, and build a business that we can pass on to the next generation. That sort of gives a relief such that whenever things happen, you’re not too bothered or extremely worried or too shaken.
You noted that you attended school in South Africa. How did your academic journey go?        
My educational journey was quite an experience. During my secondary education at Queens College, Yaba, Lagos, I met amazing people who are still friends with me today. I enjoyed it. Then onto South Africa at Greenwich College where I completed my A levels. I took Mathematics but I can’t remember the second subject. I remember when I was taking my A-levels, the first course I chose was actuarial science and I was rejected; I wasn’t taken and I went for accounting. However, accounting has been interesting and it’s amazing what understanding numbers can do. Then, I studied for my first degree at the University of Johannesburg and then I got my second degree in Accounting at the University of South Africa. After that, I took my exams to qualify as a chartered accountant. So, that was my journey. I’ve been in finance and accounting for over a decade. I started my first job at the age of 20 and I have over a decade of practice.
How do you think technology will close the gaps in Nigeria’s financial sector? 
It will reach places that we cannot imagine. It will bank the unbanked. It will make things accessible, reduce costs, and make services available such that certain services can be reached by people who are presently locked out of the system. So, whether we like it or not, technology is here to stay. Technology is a game changer and the question should be how we want to use technology, how people will access technology, and how we will reward them. Let me give an instance. We want people to bank online and if the cost of accessing that service online is expensive, they’ll just stick to the traditional method. So, we have to make it a win-win situation for everyone for technology to be able to scale. For me, I love the fact that technology significantly reduces costs. For example, let’s look at the banking sector. Instead of having a branch in all vicinity and all of that, how can we leverage tech to cut that and instead make it easier and accessible for people? Look at the insurance sector; insurance penetration is just three per cent and we can do way more. The technological advantage can help us increase the penetration to 10 per cent, 20 per cent, and even more. We can leverage tech to make that happen. We should be asking ourselves how to sell insurance as if we are selling groceries.
Do you consider yourself a big dreamer and goal-getter as a young lady?
When Amazon became a trillionaire company, they said this was just the beginning. Imagine Amazon, a company worth trillions saying it was just the beginning. So, this is just the start of my career also. We’ve not even scratched the surface yet.
Which of your career achievements do you consider as memorable?
In terms of my career highlight, it was when the Nigerian Stock Exchange recognised our work in financial inclusion and literacy; that was huge. The stock market of a $33trn dollar company recognising your work is huge. That was very helpful because when the stock market of the country with the largest gross domestic product in Africa recognised my work.      
Which among the decisions you took reshaped you and your career?
I don’t think there was one decision; I just think it was a compilation of multiple small decisions that did it for me – my father’s role in encouraging me, getting a degree in finance, working in finance, being broke, and wanting to do better with my own money. All these experiences, my working experiences, picking up my phone to open an Instagram page to teach people about personal finance, and every other step in the process helped me.  Related News

Have you been discriminated against or looked down upon based on age or gender?
Discrimination is very subjective and I wouldn’t use the word discrimination but I remember when we were fundraising for Ladda NG and considering the work we had done, it was difficult and probably if I were a man, it would have been easier to raise funds. Then the question they tended to ask me during the fundraiser was about what we had done. Research stated that when women are raising, they ask them more about what they have done as opposed to when they’re interviewing male founders when they are more futuristic.
In a world where women face different challenges, where do you think many women can find strengths?
I think on the financial part, it is good to leverage what you are good at. A lot of people will tell you to work on your weaknesses but I think you should double down on your strengths, and work hard on your strengths. That gives you a competitive advantage; you already have an edge.
What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?  
Well, I believe that as long as you have life, there’s hope. So, if you can stay alive long enough, you can see magic happen. So, continue doing what you’re doing, and stay resilient and optimistic. Also, it is important to know when to stop when something isn’t working, it is good to know when to stop.
Not much is available to the public about your relationship. Are you married?
No, I’m not married.

After that, I took my exams to qualify as a chartered accountant. So, that was my journey. I’ve been in finance and accounting for over a decade. I started my first job at the age of 20 and I have over a decade of practice.
How do you think technology will close the gaps in Nigeria’s financial sector? 
It will reach places that we cannot imagine. It will bank the unbanked. It will make things accessible, reduce costs, and make services available such that certain services can be reached by people who are presently locked out of the system. So, whether we like it or not, technology is here to stay. Technology is a game changer and the question should be how we want to use technology, how people will access technology, and how we will reward them. Let me give an instance. We want people to bank online and if the cost of accessing that service online is expensive, they’ll just stick to the traditional method. So, we have to make it a win-win situation for everyone for technology to be able to scale. For me, I love the fact that technology significantly reduces costs. For example, let’s look at the banking sector. Instead of having a branch in all vicinity and all of that, how can we leverage tech to cut that and instead make it easier and accessible for people? Look at the insurance sector; insurance penetration is just three per cent and we can do way more. The technological advantage can help us increase the penetration to 10 per cent, 20 per cent, and even more. We can leverage tech to make that happen. We should be asking ourselves how to sell insurance as if we are selling groceries.
Do you consider yourself a big dreamer and goal-getter as a young lady?
When Amazon became a trillionaire company, they said this was just the beginning. Imagine Amazon, a company worth trillions saying it was just the beginning. So, this is just the start of my career also. We’ve not even scratched the surface yet.
Which of your career achievements do you consider as memorable?
In terms of my career highlight, it was when the Nigerian Stock Exchange recognised our work in financial inclusion and literacy; that was huge. The stock market of a $33trn dollar company recognising your work is huge. That was very helpful because when the stock market of the country with the largest gross domestic product in Africa recognised my work.      
Which among the decisions you took reshaped you and your career?
I don’t think there was one decision; I just think it was a compilation of multiple small decisions that did it for me – my father’s role in encouraging me, getting a degree in finance, working in finance, being broke, and wanting to do better with my own money. All these experiences, my working experiences, picking up my phone to open an Instagram page to teach people about personal finance, and every other step in the process helped me.  Related News

Have you been discriminated against or looked down upon based on age or gender?
Discrimination is very subjective and I wouldn’t use the word discrimination but I remember when we were fundraising for Ladda NG and considering the work we had done, it was difficult and probably if I were a man, it would have been easier to raise funds. Then the question they tended to ask me during the fundraiser was about what we had done. Research stated that when women are raising, they ask them more about what they have done as opposed to when they’re interviewing male founders when they are more futuristic.
In a world where women face different challenges, where do you think many women can find strengths?
I think on the financial part, it is good to leverage what you are good at. A lot of people will tell you to work on your weaknesses but I think you should double down on your strengths, and work hard on your strengths. That gives you a competitive advantage; you already have an edge.
What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?  
Well, I believe that as long as you have life, there’s hope. So, if you can stay alive long enough, you can see magic happen. So, continue doing what you’re doing, and stay resilient and optimistic. Also, it is important to know when to stop when something isn’t working, it is good to know when to stop.
Not much is available to the public about your relationship. Are you married?
No, I’m not married.
As a successful woman, how do you deal with the attention you get from men?
I will not want to answer that.
What was the motive behind Money Africa Kids, what’s it about?
During the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a lockdown and the children were home, I thought about what we do to make children learn while they were at home. So, when parents or adults came to us to learn about money, their comments were always that they wished that they knew this when they were at a young age. Based on research, at the age of seven, your mindset about money has been formed and this can be from what your parents say about money, what they do with money, and how they behave towards money. So, we decided to go after the kids. We started having summer boot camps where we taught children online about money. We educated them and before we knew it, we said we did not want to teach them during summer alone, we wanted a product that would teach them all year long and that was how we launched Money Africa Kids. It’s a financial literacy platform for children where we teach them about money and other financial knowledge like budgeting, investing, the stock market, and many other things and I’m very excited about it.      
Why do you think kids should be financially literate before coming of age?
It helps them and it saves them time. Many people are in their 30s and sometimes in their 40s before they start knowing what financial literacy is. So, we can give them a head start. Time plays a critical role in investing and the earlier you start learning about it, the better. We want to catch them young and engrave it in their mindset so that when they start making money, they have an edge over their peers and other adults or people who do not have that knowledge.
Is it correct to say you started Money Africa Kids to help children acquire financial knowledge you lacked when you were a kid?
Yes, due to the financial knowledge I lacked but most importantly it was a running thing. Also, the educational system does not capture that and we also wanted to bridge that gap.
What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your bid to reduce financial illiteracy in Africa?
The biggest challenge we have to face is scaling. It’s one to go from zero to one and it’s another thing entirely to go from one to 10. We are currently at that point of hacking scale and we are facing challenges such as distribution, language barrier, trust in the system (which is a big one), and changing mindset from short term to long term which goes back again to the trust deficit highlighted in the previous one. I think I will sit back and start relaxing once we’ve reached at least 10 million Africans.
How do you find a balance between your work life and your social life?        
I try to inculcate a work-life balance. I love to engage in other curricular activities. I am quite intentional about nourishing other areas of my life in balance with work.
What is your drive?
I want to see a financially literate Africa. Based on research, financial literacy in Africa is low. So, we want to bridge that gap for Africans and teach people financial literacy in indigenous languages. That’s our big dream.
                                             Well, my parents. My father was an astute entrepreneur when I was a child. He went to the DR Congo, where he didn’t even understand the language of the people who spoke French and Lingala, but he went there and built a couple of businesses. He built businesses in Congo, South Africa, and Nigeria. So, it’s my parents. My dad must have picked my interest in entrepreneurship.      
Growing up was interesting. I’ll say that my father has been instrumental in our lives; he’s a dreamer and we picked up that dream from him. My mum is a very sweet and kind mother who sells me hope, joy, and love. It’s just been a blessing being children of these amazing people. In terms of my siblings, my sister and I are super close. She’s like a super rock and almost like a business partner because we work together, and we understand each other. So, growing up being the child of my parents having fantastic siblings has been insightful and interesting.
 How did you establish Money Africa?
After I was done in South Africa, I relocated back home to Nigeria and I got my first job with CNBC Africa in Lagos but something interesting happened. Although I have two degrees in finance and worked for about four years in Finance in South Africa, when I came back to Nigeria, I was broke. I was living from hand to mouth in South Africa despite having a decent income; I didn’t apply any of my personal finance knowledge. Also, the only car I had which I was thinking about selling and then bringing the money back to Nigeria, got stolen and the car didn’t have insurance. So, I came back to Nigeria broke. I remember being in church and my mum squeezed N500 into my hand as an offering and that day, I cried. That was the day I told myself that I never wanted that to happen again. So, I had to start teaching myself about personal finance.
At that time, there was no one place where one could learn about finance; it was disjointed. So, I learnt in a couple of places. Thus, I taught myself about money and moved from CNBC Africa to Bloomberg TV Africa, and from there I worked with British American Tobacco as a commercial finance manager. When I turned 30, I knew it was time and I started my own business. At the same time, I had just started teaching people about money on social media. That was how it started and it blew up in my face. In six months, we had about 20,000 followers and I knew that it was time to take it to the next level and that was how Money Africa started that year (in 2018). So, we applied technology, had courses set on the website, had a subscription module, and all of that. However, on the journey of building Money Africa, people always ask us one question: How can I invest? That was what gave birth to Ladda NG, a one-stop financial platform where you can invest; we also started putting considerations because the way a 21-year-old would invest is different from the way a 40-year-old would invest. That’s the advisory arm of the business where you’re able to identify people’s unique situations and guide them to the right investment. So, that was how we built Ladda. It was also borne out of the passion for personal finance. Now, we have savings, and investments, among others.
You’re a chartered accountant with over 10 years of experience. How would you describe your experience as an entrepreneur?
To be honest, there are high days and there are low days. I wouldn’t say it is a rollercoaster but nothing is guaranteed, really. You just have to continue to build. However, one thing that has been helpful is that we see business as a long-term plan. So, you’re not obsessed about a year but you’re thinking about a decade. So, we are thinking about how we will build for the next 10 years, build for the next 20 years, and build a business that we can pass on to the next generation. That sort of gives a relief such that whenever things happen, you’re not too bothered or extremely worried or too shaken.
You noted that you attended school in South Africa. How did your academic journey go?        
My educational journey was quite an experience. During my secondary education at Queens College, Yaba, Lagos, I met amazing people who are still friends with me today. I enjoyed it. Then onto South Africa at Greenwich College where I completed my A levels. I took Mathematics but I can’t remember the second subject. I remember when I was taking my A-levels, the first course I chose was actuarial science and I was rejected; I wasn’t taken and I went for accounting. However, accounting has been interesting and it’s amazing what understanding numbers can do. Then, I studied for my first degree at the University of Johannesburg and then I got my second degree in Accounting at the University of South Africa. After that, I took my exams to qualify as a chartered accountant. So, that was my journey. I’ve been in finance and accounting for over a decade.

That’s the advisory arm of the business where you’re able to identify people’s unique situations and guide them to the right investment. So, that was how we built Ladda. It was also borne out of the passion for personal finance. Now, we have savings, and investments, among others.
You’re a chartered accountant with over 10 years of experience. How would you describe your experience as an entrepreneur?
To be honest, there are high days and there are low days. I wouldn’t say it is a rollercoaster but nothing is guaranteed, really. You just have to continue to build. However, one thing that has been helpful is that we see business as a long-term plan. So, you’re not obsessed about a year but you’re thinking about a decade. So, we are thinking about how we will build for the next 10 years, build for the next 20 years, and build a business that we can pass on to the next generation. That sort of gives a relief such that whenever things happen, you’re not too bothered or extremely worried or too shaken.
You noted that you attended school in South Africa. How did your academic journey go?        
My educational journey was quite an experience. During my secondary education at Queens College, Yaba, Lagos, I met amazing people who are still friends with me today. I enjoyed it. Then onto South Africa at Greenwich College where I completed my A levels. I took Mathematics but I can’t remember the second subject. I remember when I was taking my A-levels, the first course I chose was actuarial science and I was rejected; I wasn’t taken and I went for accounting. However, accounting has been interesting and it’s amazing what understanding numbers can do. Then, I studied for my first degree at the University of Johannesburg and then I got my second degree in Accounting at the University of South Africa. After that, I took my exams to qualify as a chartered accountant. So, that was my journey. I’ve been in finance and accounting for over a decade. I started my first job at the age of 20 and I have over a decade of practice.
How do you think technology will close the gaps in Nigeria’s financial sector? 
It will reach places that we cannot imagine. It will bank the unbanked. It will make things accessible, reduce costs, and make services available such that certain services can be reached by people who are presently locked out of the system. So, whether we like it or not, technology is here to stay. Technology is a game changer and the question should be how we want to use technology, how people will access technology, and how we will reward them. Let me give an instance. We want people to bank online and if the cost of accessing that service online is expensive, they’ll just stick to the traditional method. So, we have to make it a win-win situation for everyone for technology to be able to scale. For me, I love the fact that technology significantly reduces costs. For example, let’s look at the banking sector. Instead of having a branch in all vicinity and all of that, how can we leverage tech to cut that and instead make it easier and accessible for people? Look at the insurance sector; insurance penetration is just three per cent and we can do way more. The technological advantage can help us increase the penetration to 10 per cent, 20 per cent, and even more. We can leverage tech to make that happen. We should be asking ourselves how to sell insurance as if we are selling groceries.
Do you consider yourself a big dreamer and goal-getter as a young lady?
When Amazon became a trillionaire company, they said this was just the beginning. Imagine Amazon, a company worth trillions saying it was just the beginning. So, this is just the start of my career also. We’ve not even scratched the surface yet.
Which of your career achievements do you consider as memorable?
In terms of my career highlight, it was when the Nigerian Stock Exchange recognised our work in financial inclusion and literacy; that was huge. The stock market of a $33trn dollar company recognising your work is huge. That was very helpful because when the stock market of the country with the largest gross domestic product in Africa recognised my work.      
Which among the decisions you took reshaped you and your career?
I don’t think there was one decision; I just think it was a compilation of multiple small decisions that did it for me – my father’s role in encouraging me, getting a degree in finance, working in finance, being broke, and wanting to do better with my own money. All these experiences, my working experiences, picking up my phone to open an Instagram page to teach people about personal finance, and every other step in the process helped me.  Related News

Have you been discriminated against or looked down upon based on age or gender?
Discrimination is very subjective and I wouldn’t use the word discrimination but I remember when we were fundraising for Ladda NG and considering the work we had done, it was difficult and probably if I were a man, it would have been easier to raise funds. Then the question they tended to ask me during the fundraiser was about what we had done. Research stated that when women are raising, they ask them more about what they have done as opposed to when they’re interviewing male founders when they are more futuristic.
In a world where women face different challenges, where do you think many women can find strengths?
I think on the financial part, it is good to leverage what you are good at. A lot of people will tell you to work on your weaknesses but I think you should double down on your strengths, and work hard on your strengths. That gives you a competitive advantage; you already have an edge.
What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?  
Well, I believe that as long as you have life, there’s hope. So, if you can stay alive long enough, you can see magic happen. So, continue doing what you’re doing, and stay resilient and optimistic. Also, it is important to know when to stop when something isn’t working, it is good to know when to stop.
Not much is available to the public about your relationship. Are you married?
No, I’m not married.
As a successful woman, how do you deal with the attention you get from men?
I will not want to answer that.
What was the motive behind Money Africa Kids, what’s it about?
During the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a lockdown and the children were home, I thought about what we do to make children learn while they were at home. So, when parents or adults came to us to learn about money, their comments were always that they wished that they knew this when they were at a young age. Based on research, at the age of seven, your mindset about money has been formed and this can be from what your parents say about money, what they do with money, and how they behave towards money. So, we decided to go after the kids. We started having summer boot camps where we taught children online about money. We educated them and before we knew it, we said we did not want to teach them during summer alone, we wanted a product that would teach them all year long and that was how we launched Money Africa Kids. It’s a financial literacy platform for children where we teach them about money and other financial knowledge like budgeting, investing, the stock market, and many other things and I’m very excited about it.      
Why do you think kids should be financially literate before coming of age?
It helps them and it saves them time. Many people are in their 30s and sometimes in their 40s before they start knowing what financial literacy is. So, we can give them a head start. Time plays a critical role in investing and the earlier you start learning about it, the better. We want to catch them young and engrave it in their mindset so that when they start making money, they have an edge over their peers and other adults or people who do not have that knowledge.
Is it correct to say you started Money Africa Kids to help children acquire financial knowledge you lacked when you were a kid?
Yes, due to the financial knowledge I lacked but most importantly it was a running thing. Also, the educational system does not capture that and we also wanted to bridge that gap.
What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your bid to reduce financial illiteracy in Africa?
The biggest challenge we have to face is scaling. It’s one to go from zero to one and it’s another thing entirely to go from one to 10. We are currently at that point of hacking scale and we are facing challenges such as distribution, language barrier, trust in the system (which is a big one), and changing mindset from short term to long term which goes back again to the trust deficit highlighted in the previous one. I think I will sit back and start relaxing once we’ve reached at least 10 million Africans.
How do you find a balance between your work life and your social life?        
I try to inculcate a work-life balance. I love to engage in other curricular activities. I am quite intentional about nourishing other areas of my life in balance with work.
What is your drive?
I want to see a financially literate Africa. Based on research, financial literacy in Africa is low. So, we want to bridge that gap for Africans and teach people financial literacy in indigenous languages. That’s our big dream.
                                             After I was done in South Africa, I relocated back home to Nigeria and I got my first job with CNBC Africa in Lagos but something interesting happened. Although I have two degrees in finance and worked for about four years in Finance in South Africa, when I came back to Nigeria, I was broke. I was living from hand to mouth in South Africa despite having a decent income; I didn’t apply any of my personal finance knowledge. Also, the only car I had which I was thinking about selling and then bringing the money back to Nigeria, got stolen and the car didn’t have insurance. So, I came back to Nigeria broke. I remember being in church and my mum squeezed N500 into my hand as an offering and that day, I cried. That was the day I told myself that I never wanted that to happen again. So, I had to start teaching myself about personal finance.
At that time, there was no one place where one could learn about finance; it was disjointed. So, I learnt in a couple of places. Thus, I taught myself about money and moved from CNBC Africa to Bloomberg TV Africa, and from there I worked with British American Tobacco as a commercial finance manager. When I turned 30, I knew it was time and I started my own business. At the same time, I had just started teaching people about money on social media. That was how it started and it blew up in my face. In six months, we had about 20,000 followers and I knew that it was time to take it to the next level and that was how Money Africa started that year (in 2018). So, we applied technology, had courses set on the website, had a subscription module, and all of that. However, on the journey of building Money Africa, people always ask us one question: How can I invest? That was what gave birth to Ladda NG, a one-stop financial platform where you can invest; we also started putting considerations because the way a 21-year-old would invest is different from the way a 40-year-old would invest.

For example, let’s look at the banking sector. Instead of having a branch in all vicinity and all of that, how can we leverage tech to cut that and instead make it easier and accessible for people? Look at the insurance sector; insurance penetration is just three per cent and we can do way more. The technological advantage can help us increase the penetration to 10 per cent, 20 per cent, and even more. We can leverage tech to make that happen. We should be asking ourselves how to sell insurance as if we are selling groceries.
Do you consider yourself a big dreamer and goal-getter as a young lady?
When Amazon became a trillionaire company, they said this was just the beginning. Imagine Amazon, a company worth trillions saying it was just the beginning. So, this is just the start of my career also. We’ve not even scratched the surface yet.
Which of your career achievements do you consider as memorable?
In terms of my career highlight, it was when the Nigerian Stock Exchange recognised our work in financial inclusion and literacy; that was huge. The stock market of a $33trn dollar company recognising your work is huge. That was very helpful because when the stock market of the country with the largest gross domestic product in Africa recognised my work.      
Which among the decisions you took reshaped you and your career?
I don’t think there was one decision; I just think it was a compilation of multiple small decisions that did it for me – my father’s role in encouraging me, getting a degree in finance, working in finance, being broke, and wanting to do better with my own money. All these experiences, my working experiences, picking up my phone to open an Instagram page to teach people about personal finance, and every other step in the process helped me.  Related News

Have you been discriminated against or looked down upon based on age or gender?
Discrimination is very subjective and I wouldn’t use the word discrimination but I remember when we were fundraising for Ladda NG and considering the work we had done, it was difficult and probably if I were a man, it would have been easier to raise funds. Then the question they tended to ask me during the fundraiser was about what we had done. Research stated that when women are raising, they ask them more about what they have done as opposed to when they’re interviewing male founders when they are more futuristic.
In a world where women face different challenges, where do you think many women can find strengths?
I think on the financial part, it is good to leverage what you are good at. A lot of people will tell you to work on your weaknesses but I think you should double down on your strengths, and work hard on your strengths. That gives you a competitive advantage; you already have an edge.
What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?  
Well, I believe that as long as you have life, there’s hope. So, if you can stay alive long enough, you can see magic happen. So, continue doing what you’re doing, and stay resilient and optimistic. Also, it is important to know when to stop when something isn’t working, it is good to know when to stop.
Not much is available to the public about your relationship. Are you married?
No, I’m not married.
As a successful woman, how do you deal with the attention you get from men?
I will not want to answer that.
What was the motive behind Money Africa Kids, what’s it about?
During the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a lockdown and the children were home, I thought about what we do to make children learn while they were at home. So, when parents or adults came to us to learn about money, their comments were always that they wished that they knew this when they were at a young age. Based on research, at the age of seven, your mindset about money has been formed and this can be from what your parents say about money, what they do with money, and how they behave towards money. So, we decided to go after the kids. We started having summer boot camps where we taught children online about money. We educated them and before we knew it, we said we did not want to teach them during summer alone, we wanted a product that would teach them all year long and that was how we launched Money Africa Kids. It’s a financial literacy platform for children where we teach them about money and other financial knowledge like budgeting, investing, the stock market, and many other things and I’m very excited about it.      
Why do you think kids should be financially literate before coming of age?
It helps them and it saves them time. Many people are in their 30s and sometimes in their 40s before they start knowing what financial literacy is. So, we can give them a head start. Time plays a critical role in investing and the earlier you start learning about it, the better. We want to catch them young and engrave it in their mindset so that when they start making money, they have an edge over their peers and other adults or people who do not have that knowledge.
Is it correct to say you started Money Africa Kids to help children acquire financial knowledge you lacked when you were a kid?
Yes, due to the financial knowledge I lacked but most importantly it was a running thing. Also, the educational system does not capture that and we also wanted to bridge that gap.
What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your bid to reduce financial illiteracy in Africa?
The biggest challenge we have to face is scaling. It’s one to go from zero to one and it’s another thing entirely to go from one to 10. We are currently at that point of hacking scale and we are facing challenges such as distribution, language barrier, trust in the system (which is a big one), and changing mindset from short term to long term which goes back again to the trust deficit highlighted in the previous one. I think I will sit back and start relaxing once we’ve reached at least 10 million Africans.
How do you find a balance between your work life and your social life?        
I try to inculcate a work-life balance. I love to engage in other curricular activities. I am quite intentional about nourishing other areas of my life in balance with work.
What is your drive?
I want to see a financially literate Africa. Based on research, financial literacy in Africa is low. So, we want to bridge that gap for Africans and teach people financial literacy in indigenous languages. That’s our big dream.
                                             To be honest, there are high days and there are low days. I wouldn’t say it is a rollercoaster but nothing is guaranteed, really. You just have to continue to build. However, one thing that has been helpful is that we see business as a long-term plan. So, you’re not obsessed about a year but you’re thinking about a decade. So, we are thinking about how we will build for the next 10 years, build for the next 20 years, and build a business that we can pass on to the next generation. That sort of gives a relief such that whenever things happen, you’re not too bothered or extremely worried or too shaken.
You noted that you attended school in South Africa. How did your academic journey go?        
My educational journey was quite an experience. During my secondary education at Queens College, Yaba, Lagos, I met amazing people who are still friends with me today. I enjoyed it. Then onto South Africa at Greenwich College where I completed my A levels. I took Mathematics but I can’t remember the second subject. I remember when I was taking my A-levels, the first course I chose was actuarial science and I was rejected; I wasn’t taken and I went for accounting. However, accounting has been interesting and it’s amazing what understanding numbers can do. Then, I studied for my first degree at the University of Johannesburg and then I got my second degree in Accounting at the University of South Africa. After that, I took my exams to qualify as a chartered accountant. So, that was my journey. I’ve been in finance and accounting for over a decade. I started my first job at the age of 20 and I have over a decade of practice.
How do you think technology will close the gaps in Nigeria’s financial sector? 
It will reach places that we cannot imagine. It will bank the unbanked. It will make things accessible, reduce costs, and make services available such that certain services can be reached by people who are presently locked out of the system. So, whether we like it or not, technology is here to stay. Technology is a game changer and the question should be how we want to use technology, how people will access technology, and how we will reward them. Let me give an instance. We want people to bank online and if the cost of accessing that service online is expensive, they’ll just stick to the traditional method. So, we have to make it a win-win situation for everyone for technology to be able to scale. For me, I love the fact that technology significantly reduces costs.

The stock market of a $33trn dollar company recognising your work is huge. That was very helpful because when the stock market of the country with the largest gross domestic product in Africa recognised my work.      
Which among the decisions you took reshaped you and your career?
I don’t think there was one decision; I just think it was a compilation of multiple small decisions that did it for me – my father’s role in encouraging me, getting a degree in finance, working in finance, being broke, and wanting to do better with my own money. All these experiences, my working experiences, picking up my phone to open an Instagram page to teach people about personal finance, and every other step in the process helped me.  Related News

Have you been discriminated against or looked down upon based on age or gender?
Discrimination is very subjective and I wouldn’t use the word discrimination but I remember when we were fundraising for Ladda NG and considering the work we had done, it was difficult and probably if I were a man, it would have been easier to raise funds. Then the question they tended to ask me during the fundraiser was about what we had done. Research stated that when women are raising, they ask them more about what they have done as opposed to when they’re interviewing male founders when they are more futuristic.
In a world where women face different challenges, where do you think many women can find strengths?
I think on the financial part, it is good to leverage what you are good at. A lot of people will tell you to work on your weaknesses but I think you should double down on your strengths, and work hard on your strengths. That gives you a competitive advantage; you already have an edge.
What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?  
Well, I believe that as long as you have life, there’s hope. So, if you can stay alive long enough, you can see magic happen. So, continue doing what you’re doing, and stay resilient and optimistic. Also, it is important to know when to stop when something isn’t working, it is good to know when to stop.
Not much is available to the public about your relationship. Are you married?
No, I’m not married.
As a successful woman, how do you deal with the attention you get from men?
I will not want to answer that.
What was the motive behind Money Africa Kids, what’s it about?
During the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a lockdown and the children were home, I thought about what we do to make children learn while they were at home. So, when parents or adults came to us to learn about money, their comments were always that they wished that they knew this when they were at a young age. Based on research, at the age of seven, your mindset about money has been formed and this can be from what your parents say about money, what they do with money, and how they behave towards money. So, we decided to go after the kids. We started having summer boot camps where we taught children online about money. We educated them and before we knew it, we said we did not want to teach them during summer alone, we wanted a product that would teach them all year long and that was how we launched Money Africa Kids. It’s a financial literacy platform for children where we teach them about money and other financial knowledge like budgeting, investing, the stock market, and many other things and I’m very excited about it.      
Why do you think kids should be financially literate before coming of age?
It helps them and it saves them time. Many people are in their 30s and sometimes in their 40s before they start knowing what financial literacy is. So, we can give them a head start. Time plays a critical role in investing and the earlier you start learning about it, the better. We want to catch them young and engrave it in their mindset so that when they start making money, they have an edge over their peers and other adults or people who do not have that knowledge.
Is it correct to say you started Money Africa Kids to help children acquire financial knowledge you lacked when you were a kid?
Yes, due to the financial knowledge I lacked but most importantly it was a running thing. Also, the educational system does not capture that and we also wanted to bridge that gap.
What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your bid to reduce financial illiteracy in Africa?
The biggest challenge we have to face is scaling. It’s one to go from zero to one and it’s another thing entirely to go from one to 10. We are currently at that point of hacking scale and we are facing challenges such as distribution, language barrier, trust in the system (which is a big one), and changing mindset from short term to long term which goes back again to the trust deficit highlighted in the previous one. I think I will sit back and start relaxing once we’ve reached at least 10 million Africans.
How do you find a balance between your work life and your social life?        
I try to inculcate a work-life balance. I love to engage in other curricular activities. I am quite intentional about nourishing other areas of my life in balance with work.
What is your drive?
I want to see a financially literate Africa. Based on research, financial literacy in Africa is low. So, we want to bridge that gap for Africans and teach people financial literacy in indigenous languages. That’s our big dream.
                                             It will reach places that we cannot imagine. It will bank the unbanked. It will make things accessible, reduce costs, and make services available such that certain services can be reached by people who are presently locked out of the system. So, whether we like it or not, technology is here to stay. Technology is a game changer and the question should be how we want to use technology, how people will access technology, and how we will reward them. Let me give an instance. We want people to bank online and if the cost of accessing that service online is expensive, they’ll just stick to the traditional method. So, we have to make it a win-win situation for everyone for technology to be able to scale. For me, I love the fact that technology significantly reduces costs. For example, let’s look at the banking sector. Instead of having a branch in all vicinity and all of that, how can we leverage tech to cut that and instead make it easier and accessible for people? Look at the insurance sector; insurance penetration is just three per cent and we can do way more. The technological advantage can help us increase the penetration to 10 per cent, 20 per cent, and even more. We can leverage tech to make that happen. We should be asking ourselves how to sell insurance as if we are selling groceries.

It’s a financial literacy platform for children where we teach them about money and other financial knowledge like budgeting, investing, the stock market, and many other things and I’m very excited about it.      
Why do you think kids should be financially literate before coming of age?
It helps them and it saves them time. Many people are in their 30s and sometimes in their 40s before they start knowing what financial literacy is. So, we can give them a head start. Time plays a critical role in investing and the earlier you start learning about it, the better. We want to catch them young and engrave it in their mindset so that when they start making money, they have an edge over their peers and other adults or people who do not have that knowledge.
Is it correct to say you started Money Africa Kids to help children acquire financial knowledge you lacked when you were a kid?
Yes, due to the financial knowledge I lacked but most importantly it was a running thing. Also, the educational system does not capture that and we also wanted to bridge that gap.
What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your bid to reduce financial illiteracy in Africa?
The biggest challenge we have to face is scaling. It’s one to go from zero to one and it’s another thing entirely to go from one to 10. We are currently at that point of hacking scale and we are facing challenges such as distribution, language barrier, trust in the system (which is a big one), and changing mindset from short term to long term which goes back again to the trust deficit highlighted in the previous one. I think I will sit back and start relaxing once we’ve reached at least 10 million Africans.
How do you find a balance between your work life and your social life?        
I try to inculcate a work-life balance. I love to engage in other curricular activities. I am quite intentional about nourishing other areas of my life in balance with work.
What is your drive?
I want to see a financially literate Africa. Based on research, financial literacy in Africa is low. So, we want to bridge that gap for Africans and teach people financial literacy in indigenous languages. That’s our big dream.
                                             Which among the decisions you took reshaped you and your career?
I don’t think there was one decision; I just think it was a compilation of multiple small decisions that did it for me – my father’s role in encouraging me, getting a degree in finance, working in finance, being broke, and wanting to do better with my own money. All these experiences, my working experiences, picking up my phone to open an Instagram page to teach people about personal finance, and every other step in the process helped me.  Related News

Have you been discriminated against or looked down upon based on age or gender?
Discrimination is very subjective and I wouldn’t use the word discrimination but I remember when we were fundraising for Ladda NG and considering the work we had done, it was difficult and probably if I were a man, it would have been easier to raise funds. Then the question they tended to ask me during the fundraiser was about what we had done. Research stated that when women are raising, they ask them more about what they have done as opposed to when they’re interviewing male founders when they are more futuristic.
In a world where women face different challenges, where do you think many women can find strengths?
I think on the financial part, it is good to leverage what you are good at. A lot of people will tell you to work on your weaknesses but I think you should double down on your strengths, and work hard on your strengths. That gives you a competitive advantage; you already have an edge.
What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you?  
Well, I believe that as long as you have life, there’s hope. So, if you can stay alive long enough, you can see magic happen. So, continue doing what you’re doing, and stay resilient and optimistic. Also, it is important to know when to stop when something isn’t working, it is good to know when to stop.
Not much is available to the public about your relationship. Are you married?
No, I’m not married.
As a successful woman, how do you deal with the attention you get from men?
I will not want to answer that.
What was the motive behind Money Africa Kids, what’s it about?
During the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a lockdown and the children were home, I thought about what we do to make children learn while they were at home. So, when parents or adults came to us to learn about money, their comments were always that they wished that they knew this when they were at a young age. Based on research, at the age of seven, your mindset about money has been formed and this can be from what your parents say about money, what they do with money, and how they behave towards money.

                                             Well, I believe that as long as you have life, there’s hope. So, if you can stay alive long enough, you can see magic happen. So, continue doing what you’re doing, and stay resilient and optimistic. Also, it is important to know when to stop when something isn’t working, it is good to know when to stop.
Not much is available to the public about your relationship. Are you married?
No, I’m not married.
As a successful woman, how do you deal with the attention you get from men?
I will not want to answer that.
What was the motive behind Money Africa Kids, what’s it about?
During the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a lockdown and the children were home, I thought about what we do to make children learn while they were at home. So, when parents or adults came to us to learn about money, their comments were always that they wished that they knew this when they were at a young age. Based on research, at the age of seven, your mindset about money has been formed and this can be from what your parents say about money, what they do with money, and how they behave towards money. So, we decided to go after the kids. We started having summer boot camps where we taught children online about money. We educated them and before we knew it, we said we did not want to teach them during summer alone, we wanted a product that would teach them all year long and that was how we launched Money Africa Kids. It’s a financial literacy platform for children where we teach them about money and other financial knowledge like budgeting, investing, the stock market, and many other things and I’m very excited about it.      
Why do you think kids should be financially literate before coming of age?
It helps them and it saves them time. Many people are in their 30s and sometimes in their 40s before they start knowing what financial literacy is. So, we can give them a head start. Time plays a critical role in investing and the earlier you start learning about it, the better. We want to catch them young and engrave it in their mindset so that when they start making money, they have an edge over their peers and other adults or people who do not have that knowledge.
Is it correct to say you started Money Africa Kids to help children acquire financial knowledge you lacked when you were a kid?
Yes, due to the financial knowledge I lacked but most importantly it was a running thing. Also, the educational system does not capture that and we also wanted to bridge that gap.
What is the biggest challenge you have faced in your bid to reduce financial illiteracy in Africa?
The biggest challenge we have to face is scaling. It’s one to go from zero to one and it’s another thing entirely to go from one to 10. We are currently at that point of hacking scale and we are facing challenges such as distribution, language barrier, trust in the system (which is a big one), and changing mindset from short term to long term which goes back again to the trust deficit highlighted in the previous one. I think I will sit back and start relaxing once we’ve reached at least 10 million Africans.
How do you find a balance between your work life and your social life?        
I try to inculcate a work-life balance. I love to engage in other curricular activities. I am quite intentional about nourishing other areas of my life in balance with work.

forbes climate policy hurts poor climate change,Wattsupwiththat.com,https://wattsupwiththat.com/2023/10/27/forbes-climate-policy-hurts-the-poor-more-than-climate-change/,entered parallel universe mainstream media publishes articles make sense post forbes climate policy hurts poor climate change first appeared watts,essay eric worrall entered parallel universe mainstream media publishes articles make sense climate change hurts poor way think til 2851 chars,2023-10-27T18:00:00Z,"Essay by Eric Worrall Have we all just entered a parallel universe where mainstream media publishes articles which make sense?  Climate Change Hurts The Poor: But Not The Way You Think It Does Tilak DoshiContributorOct 26, 2023,03:49pm EDT … It would seem straightforward that resolving the “climate change” problem would serve the poor the most, given that they are the hardest hit. But, by a tragic turn of irony, moves to “fight climate change” are precisely what is hurting the poor most. It is not “climate change” but the policies adopted in response to it that are the problem afflicting the poor the most. … Most of us who take affordable electricity ‘24/7’ supply for granted are unaware of the existential constraint on people’s daily lives that a lack of electricity implies. This was brought home brilliantly by Geoff Hill at a talk in House of Lords in Westminster on Monday. Geoff is Africa correspondent for The Washington Times, the first non-American John Steinbeck Award winner and has published with the Mail & Guardian(Johannesburg), The East African (Nairobi) and across the African continent. … This leads us to the third striking feature of the climate finance data collated by CPI. Within the 92% of the $640 billion spent on climate finance directed to climate mitigation in 2020 (as opposed to the 8% spent on adaptation), 91% (or $536 billion) was spent on solar and wind power. Yet no country in the world has developed without the dense energy available from fossil fuels. Asking Africans to leave their fossil fuels resources in the ground in return for “climate finance” from Western governments and multilateral agencies to invest on unreliable solar and wind power is plainly unworkable. Dilute, unreliable and intermittent power from the wind and the sun will not meet the continent’s quest for higher standards of living, to save the forests and to have clean water to drink. … Well said Tilak Doshi.  The “Geoff” referred to is Zimbabwean writer Geoff Hill, who Net Zero Watch reports spoke to the British House of Lords about how lack of reliable energy is leading Africa to burn their forests. Just like Europe almost destroyed their forests, before the large scale exploitation of coal.  Net Zero Watch also provides two documents, Paper 1: Africa’s burning issue: charcoal and the loss of forest (pdf) and Paper 2: Clean water for Africa: A dream whose time has come (pdf). I don’t have a link to Geoff’s speech, if anyone has a link please post it in comments.  I really hope this Forbes article is more than a one off glimmer of sanity. If mainstream media news outlets were to start consistently acting like real journalists again, investigating and discussing real world problems caused by climate policy, instead of uncritically cheering on every ridiculous green idea which crosses their desk for the sake of the cause, the world would rapidly become a much better place.  How does one “fight Climate change” with boxing gloves or with pages of empty anti weather diatribes? Fighting something like that is a fool’s errand that will in the end generate a lot of red faces when it becomes apparent, they were being mislead for power and money. The Climate in my Columbia Basin region is the same through the ENTIRE Holocene. BSk LINK Meanwhile, in my Ohio region, the climate has changed through the entire Holocene.  Every f***in’ five minutes! Aahhh, but Paul seems like you might be conflating weather with climate and the Propa…ahh alarmists are the only group, sanctioned by the UN, that are licensed to do that conflating thingy. Op, op, op, op
Propaganda style The “Climate Scientists” have had “climate” redefined so it is now only about 30 years.  I guess that’s all their models, given perfect information, could hope to predict. (The answer, of course, is them.) Bingo. The fight against climate change, battle against homelessness, war on drugs, etc., are nothing more than platitudes behind mechanisms for gaining control. The War On…Drugs was where they got the citizenry drugged, then made war on them.
The War On..Terror was where they terrorised the citizenry into accepting a constant state of martial law and war on the population.
The War On…Cancer was where they used the genome of an aborted fetus, with a reported 57 genetic defects known to lead to cancer, then they went to war against anyone refusing to vaccinate.
The War On…Poverty was where they crashed the stock market, then used that as a pretense to decimate the work force, outsource to China, and make war on the unemployed.
The War On… Paedophilia was introduced by a wonderful professor announcing unto us that a quarter of al men are born paedophiles, and we should accept that.
Actually, it means your government has taken over the policing of a specific product or service, and only approved monopolists will be allowed to trade. In other words, every legal proscription ringfences some economic activity for the benefit of the connected mafiosi, while the Police are tasked with protecting said monopoly from all outside interference.
It is a commonly known fact that Bill Clinton used the CIA to smuggle cocaine, heroin etc into America for the War On… Drugs. Now you go trade some home-made coke down by the Kwikki Mart, and let us know how it went for you… According to the WEF aligned globalists, you fight climate change by sending as much cash as you can muster, even raise taxation or nut zero requirements to crippling levels, it all helps! Don’t forget that the WEF stacks the deck in advance so that the cash transferred by the GovMint from the middle class to “fight climate change” aka mandate wind and solar farms, along with all the other CO2 boondoggles, ends up in the WEF member black rock accounts, with all profit taking transferred to their tax deferred trust funds. Since the Climate Change zealots are far more interested in increasing their control over what people eat, how they move around, and how much energy is available to the hoi polloi, … little things like actually protecting the environment are pushed aside. “Climate Change” (plus other things) is more about getting people acclimated to accepting the loss of freedoms and money in the name of “Saving the Planet!”
(Cue George Carlin …) https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-policies-are-hurting-the-poor-not-a-mildly-warming-planet/ Its a bit rich of developed nation leaders, the UN etc, to tell developing nations they need to protect the climate by, well, staying poor The sheer hubris is is as breathtaking as it is disturbing As western leaders try to propel their masses back to the future, the developing nations, supported by BRICS+ nations, are having none of it and nor should they “The world’s poor would be better off with less of the philanthropy practiced by the likes of Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg.” Gates, Bloomberg, Schwab, and the rest of the WEF, moreover, are the central perps of these Climate Change Policy-Caused Crimes Against Humanity. Is anyone taking on the counting of the victims of the Climate Change false front for a New World Order.  Start with the count of the policy disaster of Sri Lanka after the head of state promised he would ban fertilizers (and did so) at the Glasgow COP (use The Wayback Machine, this recent history  has been layered over with phony articles. Fellow Malthusians talk of an “ideal” population burden of only one billion. I got up this morning at 08.00, the climate was changing, as it does every day, as it has done every day for 4.5Bn years – funny that, a dynamic climate, however, those silly wind & solar farms were producing only 6% of grid demand, between them, those billions were not well stolen  spent How much of your neighbor’s money was an 08 00 hot mug of coffee worth? The modern notion of infrastructure development clearly benefits the poor as well as everyone else.  Energy being a key component of modern development, along with clean water and sanitation, effective roads and other transportation facilities, medical care, schools, internet and telecom, industrial products production, etc. The notion that forcing developing societies to ration their access to both energy and transportation is mindless drivel, driven by ideology not by any actual concern for the health, welfare, and standard of living of other human beings. “”It is not “climate change” but the policies adopted in response to it that are the problem afflicting the poor the most.”” Policies like…. “”Rich countries should stop pushing fossil fuels on Africa – don’t we deserve a renewable future too?
…those who caused the climate crisis should help Africa harness its wind and sun””
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/27/rich-countries-fossil-fuels-africa-renewables-gas-climate Africa doesn’t have the existing FF infrastructure to allow at least partial integration of insanely expensive and unreliable (disruptive) wind and solar boondoggles that the developed countries used to hide the technical and economic realities of wind and solar electric generation.  No amount of unreliables will allow for a functioning electric system in Africa. I wonder if more of these factual exposes about the irrationality of utility-scale “renewable energy” will gather momentum. Could Michael Moore’s 2019 documentary “Planet Of The Humans” have been a sleeper that has now set the rationality hounds running after the green/left loonies? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Humans Not sure about that, Tilak Doshi has been writing sanity-filled articles exposing the stupidity of energy ideology in Africa and India for quite a few years now, many reprinted on WUWT. It’s good to see him getting more traction and bigger platforms for his articles, but I’m not sure Michael Moore gets any credit with that. I don’t think we will see a landslide of accurate reporting on the climate change subject, but I have seen a couple of polls yesterday that show Americans are not so sure climate change is real as they were in the past.  They also expressed less confidence in alarmist climate scientists and whether they know what they are talking about or not. It was actually a little encouraging.  🙂 Very nice article, this is what we have been saying from the beginning. Not always as clear as this. We are winning, we need to convince the average guy and not worry so much about those in power or academia. Everyone below the “Elite Class” is hurt by the so called actions to mitigate Climate Change. Yes, the poor get hurt more, however they are adequately compensated from the significant increase in taxes upon the middle and upper middle class.  P.S. If Climate Change were a FACT and not a SCAM, even the Elites would demand that that the money be spent on Nuclear Power and not on the abyss of “Renewable Energy.” It would take the entire GDP of all countries on Earth to reach “Net Zero.” Think how rich the Elites will become and the squalor the lower middle class and poor will live in. Odd how so many of the “Elite Class” spend their money on politics and politicians to force people to accept and pay for these “solutions” rather than invest in them themselves. The Public Library in my home town was paid for, including the first set of books, back in 1904 by Carnegie. Rockefeller and Carnegie seemed to be in competition as to who would build the most Public Libraries and Universities back then.  Now the Elites seem to be in competition as to who can give the most money to third world countries to receive the recognition they seek and enrich the corrupt dictators in an effort to make them a Democracy with no regards to the fact that it only makes things WORSE. The kind of article that can at this time only be written by someone with that name while the current party is in power. WTF? I have no idea either. Bizarre. That’s a feature, not a problem. This was never about the environment. This was always about elitists confiscating wealth and consolidating power. Bloomberg’s green-energy research team estimated it would cost $US200 Trillion to stop Global Warming by 2050.  There is only $US40 trillion in cash, checking, and savings in the world. There are about 2 billion households in the world, so that is $US100,000 per household.  Ninety percent of the world’s households can’t afford anything additional so the households in developed nations will have to pay 10 times as much to cover it. That means about $US 1 million per household in developed countries or about $US 33,000 per year for 30 years. The working people can’t afford anything near that.  The millionaires and billionaires have about $US208 billion. That would cover it, but they won’t give up their wealth.
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-05/-200-trillion-is-needed-to-stop-global-warming-that-s-a-bargain#xj4y7vzkg Of course, the Earth is still in a 2.55 million-year ice age named the Quaternary Glaciation, 20% of the land is frozen, and it snows ice crystals every year. “Bloomberg’s green-energy research team estimated it would cost $US200 Trillion to stop Global Warming by 2050.” Seems like it’d be much cheaper to just periodically nuke a dormant volcano or two to activate them. Yes – the climate is moving in a positive direction as the world gently warms and greens.
‘Climate Policy’ is an elitist money grab. https://www.energylivenews.com/2023/10/27/ovo-customers-could-save-160-this-winter/ So…….National Grid is repeating its failed demand side control mechanism again this winter – OVO are participating, they have 61,000 domestic consumers with smart meters signed up – that’s a staggering 0.2% of all domestic users in the UK
If NGESO believe this mechanism will keep the lights on, instead of putting more gas, coal & nuclear generation on line, they are literally thrashing around in the dark Hmm, do those 61,000 customers with smart meters actually know they’ve been signed up for this? Volundrafted? It’s probably a case of one step forward and five steps back–in the name of diversity of thought. That’s a new management direction from zero steps forward and six steps back under the old editor bias. Well, considering climate change doesn’t hurt anyone, that’s not a hard bar to hurdle. The very thing that the greens fear – deforestation – is far more likely to be caused by their policies than by any sort of climate change. India is but another example (even though the country is technically modern, but so many of its residents don’t get to take advantage of those modern conveniences). People are always going into nature preserves and natural forests to gather firewood for cooking. If these people had access to electricity they wouldn’t need to gather firewood….. Imagine people going into state and national parks here in the US to gather firewood just to survive. Luckily we are able to preserve such areas precisely due to the high standard of living.  Even the dirt poor here in the US have access to electric or gas stoves…. “The very thing that the greens fear – deforestation – is far more likely to be caused by their policies than by any sort of climate change.” Lots of forest will have to be destroyed to install solar “farms” and industrial scale batteries in the heavily forested American northeast. Now the enviros are beginning to scream about this but they can’t seem to grasp that it’s their fault for pushing green energy and net zero laws. They actually think net zero can be gotten simply by solar on roofs. Try telling them that it’s impossible and they won’t hear you. It goes against their green religion. And of course they think green energy will be dirt cheap.  instead of uncritically cheering on every ridiculous green idea  There is cozy relationship between government and journalists.  Climate Change has become the scapegoat for every poor decision of government.  If Australia has blackouts this year, it will be due to climate change.  If Australia has damaging floods this year it will be due to climate change.  If Australia has damaging wild fires this year it will be due to climate change. Ever notice how the staff numbers in their ABC increases when ALP is in power Federally and numbers drop when LNP is in power.  ABC literally HATE LNP governments because they limit budgets.  ALP are strongly favoured because they increase numbers. Trump has never played the press well.  And the press returned the disfavour. This is an exellent article from Forbes. A very relevant point they make is defining the distinction between ‘mitigation’ and ‘adaption’. “By describing “weather” as “climate change”, policy emphasis is put on mitigation rather than adaptation to reduce the impacts of future climate change on human welfare. The implicit assumption behind mitigation is that greenhouse gases are the primary driver of climate change and trying to “fight climate change” by reducing GHGs should be the overriding priority for policymakers from Germany to South Africa.” “Adaptation is defined as directing resources to activities aimed at reducing the vulnerability of humans or natural systems to the impacts of climate change and climate-related risks. Improving adaptive capacity and resilience would include public investments in sturdier housing, better urban drainage and sewage systems to avoid flooding and disease, improving clean water supplies, improving irrigation for climate-resilient agriculture, providing access to electricity and natural gas for cooking and heating homes to substitute away from using fuelwood and charcoal, and so on.” “.. total climate finance by both private and public sources in 2020 amounted to an estimated $640 billion. Only 8% was spent on adaptation; the rest, 92%, went to mitigation. “ Whenever there’s a current, extreme weather event, and I search for the history of extreme weather events in the area, using available BOM records, or copies of ancient media reports, I usually find a record of an equally severe, or even more severe weather event in the past, before CO2 levels began rising significantly. Occasionally, there are exceptions, and a flood in a particular area might actually be the highest on record. However, when that’s the case, the cause of the unprecedented flood level is usually a result of human activity, such as changing the landscape by removing a forest, or building an elevated highway across a flood plain, which obstructs the water flow during a flood, causing a higher water level on one side of the highway. Adaption should be the priority, instead of mitigation. It amazes me that, in Australia, which is well-known as a land of floods and droughts, a major flood that occurs every few years in certain locations, continues to cause increasing damage to infrastructure and homes, as a result of a lack of adaption. Talking of the House of Lords, I sent my photo of a 10 year old Hmong tribal boy cooking lunch inside the hut in Laos, burning ‘traditional biomass’ as those horrible hypocrites call it – to his lordship the Bishop of Portsmouth when I heard that the church was ‘disinvesting’ fossil fuels.  I said that his Christian duty was to get electricity into the ‘third world’ especially Africa.  I expect my letter was ignored. I should imagine the Archbishop of Canterbury to be more receptive to a crie de coeur.",resolving the “climate change” problem would serve the poor the most. it is not “climate change” but the policies adopted in response to it. most of us who take affordable electricity ‘24/7’ supply for granted are unaware of the existential constraint on people’s daily lives.,neutral,Technology,Politics,Entertainment,2

By
                    Sophie McBain  Editor’s note: This article was originally published on 20 September. On 3 November, “Crypto King” Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of fraud and money laundering. Sophie McBain looks at whether the idealist effective altruism philosophy will survive his conviction.  The moral philosopher met a brilliant American maths student who wanted to know how he could do the most good in the world. How about becoming a banker, the philosopher said. No, seriously. Think of it like this. With his high grades, the student could do pretty much anything. He could become a doctor in a poor country, and then he might perform life-saving surgery ten times a week, saving 500 lives a year. But if he became a banker he could donate enough money to finance the salaries of ten doctors, saving ten times as many lives. Plus, if he didn’t become a doctor, someone else was likely to do the same job. But if he didn’t become a banker, who else would step in to fund the doctors? Related William MacAskill, the moral philosopher, was a leading “effective altruist”, someone who thought about morality in a scientific way, crunching the numbers to determine the “best” method of helping others. He had helped found a careers-advice organisation pitched at top graduates, one that encouraged would-be aid workers to consider more lucrative work so that they could “earn to give”.  [See also: “The biggest Ponzi of all time”: why Ben McKenzie became a crypto critic] And so the American maths student, Sam Bankman-Fried, took a job in finance, where he developed an interest in crypto. He set up his own firm and went on to make billions on crypto arbitrage, taking advantage of the price discrepancies that can arise in the digital-currency markets. He pledged hundreds of millions in donations, mostly to organisations linked to his friend, the moral philosopher. In interviews the student, by now a famous crypto king, explained that your incentives are different when you are making money in order to give it away. When you’re doing good, there are no diminishing marginal returns – and so it makes sense to take bigger gambles, to be aggressive. But the crypto king was also taking different kinds of risk. In December 2022 he was arrested and accused of defrauding his customers, owing them approximately $8bn. In February 2023, he asked his donees to return their gifts, or risk them being seized during bankruptcy proceedings. On Twitter the philosopher expressed his “utter rage” at the crypto king, and his “sadness and self-hatred” for falling for his deception. He acknowledged that he had not heeded concerns that his own moral ideas could be misused. The crypto king’s actions ran contrary to effective altruism, which emphasises “the importance of integrity, honesty and the respect of common-sense moral constraints”, he tweeted. Which would have been an adequate response if the story of the moral philosopher and the crypto king were merely a thought experiment, an abstract scenario used to test an idea. But real life is messier and more complex. On 2 November, the crypto king was convicted in a New York court on seven counts of fraud and money laundering. Questions have been asked of the philosopher, too: how much did he know? Was his big idea fundamentally flawed? The story of how the Oxford philosopher MacAskill and the effective altruism (EA) movement found itself entangled with the disgraced Bankman-Fried is partly about moral principles. Why should someone like Bankman-Fried find EA’s ideology so compelling – or at least convenient? But mostly it is about politics, the corruptive influence of power and money – the unforeseen (but not unpredictable) consequences of telling people that the best way to do good is to get rich. Now, a thought experiment. Imagine you find a toddler drowning in a shallow pond. Should you wade in and save them, even if your clothes get muddy? Well, of course! Would you agree, then, that if it’s in your power to stop something very bad from happening, at minimal cost to yourself, you should do it? What if a child is at risk of drowning in floodwaters many thousands of miles away, and a small donation could save their life? In his 1972 paper “Famine, Affluence, and Morality” the Australian philosopher Peter Singer argued that failing to contribute to disaster relief is morally equivalent to walking past a drowning toddler. Our moral obligations are much greater than almost anyone is willing to acknowledge, he wrote. It is morally wrong to buy unnecessary things – like new clothes – when we could be giving to life-saving causes. Some people encountering Singer’s paper for the first time will try to find holes in it; others might not bother. It is much easier to file this argument alongside the other inconvenient information we’re required to ignore if we are to enjoy buying pointless stuff on this ever-warming planet. Effective altruists are different. They are generally people who have always taken morality far more seriously than their peers. They were the kids who turned vegetarian aged six and gave all their pocket money to charity, who volunteered at the local homeless shelter. Some have donated a kidney to a stranger; some volunteered to take part in Covid vaccine trials. When the Bankman-Fried crisis broke, Julia Wise, the US-based community liaison for the Centre for Effective Altruism, said she felt “horrified and disappointed”. “So many people in the community had made really thoughtful choices about how to help others, and here was this person acting so recklessly and undoing other people’s good work,” she told me. A year on, she said most EAs were setting their outrage aside, as “all these important problems in the world are still there”. Alongside the extreme do-gooders, EA has long fostered a darker, millenarian streak. Since Bankman-Fried’s downfall, it has faced more reputational crises. In January this year, an email written in 1997 by Nick Bostrom – a futurist philosopher whose ideas are influential within the movement – resurfaced in which he used the N-word and said he believed that black people are more stupid than white people. (He apologised for “this disgusting email from 26 years ago… [which] does not accurately represent my views then, or now”, while adding that inequality leads to differences in skills and cognitive ability.) The following month, in a further blow for effective altruism’s reputation, Time magazine published allegations of widespread sexual harassment within the EA community. How did a school of thought built on extreme altruism provide ideological cover for racism and sexism – and end up promoting Bankman-Fried? The person best placed to answer this would be MacAskill – he helped lay out EA’s philosophical framework, has sat on the boards of many major EA institutions and formerly described Bankman-Fried as a “collaborator” – but he has remained conspicuously quiet. He declined to be interviewed for this article, citing work commitments, and hasn’t commented on Bankman-Fried publicly since June, when he said that “even in hindsight” he had no reason to suspect the billionaire of fraud. He also posted a bizarre document he’d written in the third person titled “Will MacAskill should not be the face of EA”. Even before he encountered Singer’s work, MacAskill demonstrated unusual moral zeal. While still a schoolboy, attending the private Hutchesons’ Grammar School in Glasgow, he worked at a care home for the elderly and volunteered with Glasgow Disabled Scouts. He studied philosophy at Cambridge and moved to Oxford as a postgraduate, where he met Toby Ord, a philosopher who was similarly committed to Singer’s challenge. Ord had pledged to give away all his earnings above £20,000. MacAskill followed suit. As utilitarians, both men agreed that what mattered morally wasn’t the act of donating but the impact their donations would have. A £6 gift to an animal shelter would have a negligible impact – but the same donation to a malaria charity could protect a child in the developing world from a disease that kills over 600,000 people a year. One of the central insights driving EA was that most people give surprisingly little thought to the impact of their charitable giving. Donations tend to be driven by emotion – you give to a cancer charity because your grandmother died of the disease, or to a donkey charity because donkeys are cute – rather than reason. What if we tried to direct charitable funds more strategically, to make the money go further? In 2009, Ord and MacAskill launched Giving What We Can, an organisation that encouraged people to pledge 10 per cent of their income to charity. They began with 23 members, among them Peter Singer; many of the others would go on to hold influential positions within EA organisations. One was Ben Todd, with whom MacAskill founded the careers organisation 80,000 Hours in 2011, promoting jobs that would enable graduates to give. In 2012 MacAskill and Ord founded the Centre for Effective Altruism, a charity aimed at building their movement, seeding EA chapters at universities, and encouraging the exchange of ideas at conferences and via an online EA forum. While Oxford University became a hub in the UK, EA also developed a strong presence in the US, through organisations such as GiveWell, Good Ventures and the Open Philanthropy foundation. It was also embraced by the rationalist movement, a subculture that developed around sites such as LessWrong.com and in Silicon Valley, whose adherents aim to expunge themselves of cognitive bias, applying probabilistic reasoning to every aspect of their lives. [See also: The great attention deficit: what’s fuelling the rise in adult ADHD?] For some people, the idea that moral choices are an intellectual problem – solvable with maths – is appealing. But how do you quantify good? In his 2015 book Doing Good Better, MacAskill proposed using “quality-adjusted life years” (QALYs), a measure used by welfare economists that attempts to quantify the detrimental effects of disabilities and diseases. One year in perfect health is defined as 1 QALY, while one year of life with untreated Aids is 0.5, according to the weighting cited by MacAskill; for someone living with blindness, a year of life has a QALY score of 0.4; and for someone with moderate depression it is 0.3. MacAskill writes that QALYs can be used to decide which charitable causes to prioritise: faced with a choice between spending $10,000 to save a 20-year-old from blindness or the same amount on antiretroviral therapy for a 30-year-old with Aids – a treatment that will improve their life and extend it by ten years – MacAskill argues it would be better to perform the sight-saving surgery, as the 20-year-old can expect to live another 50 years. He acknowledges that QALYs are an “imperfect”, “contested” measure but sees them as mostly good enough. And yet, using QALYs is also a scientific-sounding way of valuing the life of a sighted person over that of a blind person: it suggests that when a fire engulfs a nursery, you should save the twin with good vision first. And how do QALYs translate across species? In his 1975 book Animal Liberation, Singer argued that a chimpanzee or dog might have a greater capacity for meaningful relationships than a “severely retarded infant”; in these circumstances, Singer writes, it may be better to save the life of the animal. At what point do you stop counting? In 2013, a leading EA argued in his graduate thesis at Rutgers University that because people in richer countries are, on average, more productive and more innovative, it is better to save their lives than those of people living in poor countries. If you find such positions repugnant, is this a mistake in the maths or the measurements – or a problem of underlying values? EA encouraged robust debate on difficult subjects, but utilitarian calculations can be co-opted to justify extremely weird and potentially harmful positions. Early critics of EA also highlighted its convenient political quietism: instead of paying for bed nets and de-worming treatments for the global poor (two causes EA deems highly effective), shouldn’t its proponents be agitating for changes to a political system that puts someone earning the mean UK salary in the top 2 per cent of earners globally? The impact of political action is hard to account for in a spreadsheet, but is that a reason to avoid it? “Effective altruism doesn’t try to understand how power works, except to better align itself with it. In this sense it leaves everything just as it is,” the Oxford philosopher Amia Srinivasan wrote in the London Review of Books in 2015. Noting that EAs are mostly middle-class white men, she added: “This is no doubt comforting to those who enjoy the status quo – and may in part account for the movement’s success.” EA was the radical movement that bankers and billionaires could buy into. In the years before the Sam Bankman-Fried crisis, EA got rich fast. In 2021 Ben Todd of 80,000 Hours estimated that around $46bn had been committed to the movement worldwide. Much of this came from donors such as the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna, who had committed to giving away a majority of their estimated $25bn fortune through their EA-affiliated organisations Open Philanthropy and Good Ventures. And then there was Bankman-Fried. In February 2022 Bankman-Fried launched another philanthropic organisation, the FTX Future Fund. MacAskill was on the advisory board. The fund pledged to spend “up to $1bn” in its first year, and by June 2022 claimed to have spent $132m. Of these grants, $36.5m went to charities and institutions grouped under the umbrella organisation Effective Ventures UK, at least four of which were co-founded by MacAskill: Giving What We Can, the Centre for Effective Altruism, 80,000 Hours and the Global Priorities Institute, a research centre. (MacAskill also chaired the trustees of Effective Ventures UK until 21 September, the day after this article went to press.) A few mega-donors now wielded a huge amount of unaccountable power over the movement. But few EA leaders, many of whom are academic philosophers, had practical experience of running large businesses or charities. In interviews with me, disillusioned former members accused the leadership of arrogance. “The leaders were intellectually elitist and thought that, on their intelligence alone, they could make decisions better than people who had practical, demonstrable skills,” said one – who, like many people I spoke to, requested anonymity for fear of reprisals. “I honestly felt terrified… there were no adults in the room.” The leadership was cliquey, and professional boundaries were blurred: EA’s donors, its executive teams, trustees and many beneficiaries were long-standing friends. Former members told me the movement became a bubble: people worked together, hung out together, slept together and consulted the same EA therapists. People were sometimes afraid to criticise EA decisions because they worried about being seen as stupid, Larissa Hesketh-Rowe, a former CEO of the Centre for Effective Altruism, told me. “It could be hard to raise concerns and criticise decisions in a community so focused on intellect and impact. It can be easy to feel that, if something raises alarm bells to you but no one else, maybe that’s because you’re not smart enough or dedicated enough. In reality, the community, like any other, has blind spots.” Hesketh-Rowe, who left in 2019, felt that “when people believe their cause is especially important and that they are especially smart, it can be all too easy to stray into finding ways to justify behaviour that stems from normal human flaws. You don’t like someone: maybe they are bad for the movement. You want a higher salary: maybe you need that to be productive.” As ever more funding was funnelled into EA institutions, the once ascetic movement started to shift its attitude towards money. Hesketh-Rowe told me that, “once the community got more money, there were more discussions of, ‘Well, if you can save time by spending money, maybe you should. Maybe you should take a taxi instead of taking the bus or the train. Get a nicer desk, spend more to move closer to work – if it’s going to make you more productive.’” It wasn’t a unique business philosophy, but how did it fit with EA’s principles? “The line of reasoning isn’t completely wrong, but that’s what makes it risky,” said Hesketh-Rowe. “You need strong character, a good culture and leadership to navigate it, otherwise it’s too easy to accidently drift in the direction of corruption.” This is how the movement that once agonised over the benefits of distributing $1 de-worming pills to African children ended up owning two large estates: the $3.5m Chateau Hostačov in the Czech Republic, purchased in 2022 by the small EA-affiliated European Summer Program on Rationality with a donation from Bankman-Fried’s FTX Foundation; and Wytham Abbey, a 15th-century manor house near Oxford, bought for £15m to host EA retreats and conferences. Wytham Abbey, which is undergoing restoration, was purchased by the Effective Ventures Foundation (the UK umbrella group for EA) using a £17m grant from Open Philanthropy (the US EA foundation set up by Moskovitz and Tuna). On the EA forum, several people have questioned the “optics” of this purchase: “You’ve underestimated the damage this will do to the EA brand,” wrote one in late 2022. “The hummus and baguettes signal earnestness. Abbey signals scam.” But many defended the decision: “I’ve been to about 70 conferences in my academic career, and I’m [sic] noticed that the aesthetics, antiquity and uniqueness of the venue can have a significant effect on the seriousness with which people take ideas and conversations, and the creativity of their thinking,” one user wrote, adding: “I suspect that meeting in a building constructed in 1480 might help promote longtermism and multi-century thinking.” [See also: Too big to blame: the great Libor cover-up] Last year William MacAskill published his second popular philosophy book, What We Owe the Future, which outlined why he had come to believe in long-termism, the idea that positively influencing the future is a key moral priority of our time. The book received glowing reviews and MacAskill was, inevitably, profiled by the New Yorker and Time. He celebrated its publication with a dinner at Eleven Madison Park, a vegan restaurant in Manhattan with a $438-a-head tasting menu, hosted by Bankman-Fried. At the start of his book MacAskill asks the reader to “imagine living, in order of birth, through the life of every human being who has ever lived”. You are the colonised and the coloniser, the slaveholder and the slave; you will begin 300,000 years ago in Africa and after you have reached the present day you will press on, inhabiting the lives of humans who are born a thousand, a million or even a trillion years from now, should mankind one day colonise the stars. He then asks: if you knew you were going to live all of these lives, what would you want humanity to do in the present? It struck me, reading this book after FTX imploded, that MacAskill was calling on readers to transcend their humanity and make moral decisions as if they were God. One argument for longtermism is that the suffering caused by an apocalyptic event would be so enormous that we are morally required to try to avert it, even if the possibility of such an event happening is relatively small. In a 2021 paper, MacAskill suggests that a reasonable estimate for the number of future humans is 1024 – that’s 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 people who have not yet been born and to whom we owe some responsibility. (This is a conservative estimate, MacAskill notes, because should future generations succeed in creating digitally sentient beings and colonising the Milky Way, there may be 1045 future lives.) If an intervention that reduces the risk of human extinction by 1 per cent is equivalent to saving ten quadrillion (1016) lives, spending money on bed nets suddenly doesn’t seem such a good moral investment. MacAskill goes on to calculate that, for example, spending $100 on pandemic preparedness could increase the number of future beings by 200 million, while the same donation to an anti-malaria charity will save only 0.025 lives. Critics of this form of longtermism have argued that at best it’s impractical: how can we possibly know what actions would best improve the lives of people born a million years from now, or what digital beings living on Mars would want? At worst, it is sinister, because it diverts funds away from people who are suffering now, in order to address abstract, distant problems. “Longtermism has the potential to destroy the effective altruism movement entirely, because by fiddling with the numbers, the above reasoning can be used to squash funding for any charitable cause whatsoever,” wrote Vaden Masrani, a computer scientist, in a blog response to MacAskill, noting that these estimates about the size of humanity were essentially “made-up numbers”. And yet, data analysis by the Economist found that by 2022, 40 per cent of effective altruism’s funding was directed towards longtermist causes. Much of this money was spent on AI safety, an issue that many EAs argue is more urgent than climate change. EA’s detractors have noted that the movement’s tech donors stand to benefit from influencing the conversation around how AI is developed and regulated. Dustin Moskovitz’s Open Philanthropy was an early backer of OpenAI, developed to build safe AI that would “benefit all of humanity”. Sam Bankman-Fried was one of the largest funders of Anthropic, another leading AI company that promises to make AI safer. Anthropic was also backed by Moskovitz and the Skype founder, Jaan Tallinn, a prominent EA donor. Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, who invested early in OpenAI and DeepMind, have close ties to EA figures and have both been keynote speakers at EA conferences. (Musk has claimed that effective altruism is a “close match” for his philosophy.) Asked on the EA forum what the movement had achieved, one member replied: “[Has] played a substantial role in founding all three of the top leading AI capability companies (cry emoji).” Earlier this year the prominent AI scientist Timnit Gebru described EA as a “dangerous cult”, one that discouraged its members from socialising with non-EA friends and family members, writing on her LinkedIn: “I don’t think people have any idea how much this cult is driving so much of AI.” She added that she and others had received messages from people who attended EA workshops in which they explored using violence – “such as murder and mail bombs” – to curb AI research. Gebru, who studies algorithmic bias, argues that by focusing attention on the future, big AI companies are distracting people from the real harms their technology is already causing. Even before the Bankman-Fried crisis, a movement that once prided itself on an openness to criticism and debate was closing ranks. When two researchers published a paper in 2021 criticising EA’s undemocratic approach to existential risk – arguing, as Gebru does, that the future of humanity should not be decided by a handful of tech-utopians – they said they were urged by some EAs not to publish, in case it damaged funding to the cause. On 10 November 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted that he had “f****d up”. It was an understatement. The following day, he announced that FTX had filed for bankruptcy as customers found themselves unable to withdraw their money. The five-member board of the FTX Future Fund (among them MacAskill) resigned, saying they were “shocked and immensely saddened” and “deeply regret the difficult, painful and stressful position” that the fund’s grantees were now in. The following month, Bankman-Fried was arrested. A week later the British regulator the Charity Commission opened an investigation into the Effective Ventures Foundation UK to assess the risk to its assets (it’s possible that FTX money will have to be returned) and to investigate potential conflicts of interest, as well as the way the charity was governed. Recent lawsuits have shed more light on EA’s strange turn. During an action over Musk’s purchase of Twitter, messages were released showing that MacAskill had approached Musk offering to set up a meeting with his “collaborator” Bankman-Fried to discuss buying Twitter together and “then making it better for the world”. “You vouch for him?” Musk asked. “Very much so! Very dedicated to making the long-term future of humanity go well,” MacAskill replied, directing Musk to a tweet announcing the creation of the FTX Future Fund, “in case you want to get a feel for Sam”. [See also: The algorithms quietly stoking inflation] Yet in July 2023, a lawsuit filed in a federal bankruptcy court highlighted the “frequently misguided and sometimes dystopian” projects of Bankman-Fried’s FTX Foundation (which seeded the FTX Future Fund). The foundation, according to the complaint submitted to the court, was “a purported charity that served little purpose other than to enhance the public stature of [the] defendants”. The filing pointed to a $300,000 grant given in May 2022 for an individual to write a book “on how to figure out what humans’ utility function is”, and a $400,000 grant to a group that published YouTube videos about EA. The same court document referenced a memo in which Bankman-Fried’s brother Gabe appeared to discuss plans to purchase the Pacific island of Nauru, in order to build a “bunker/shelter” that would ensure “most EAs survive” an event that wiped out between half and 99.99 per cent of the global population. In July I went to see William MacAskill speak at London’s Southbank Centre, where he – tall and boyish-looking, with a Scottish burr – shared a stage with the Oxford data scientist Hannah Ritchie and the YouTuber Ali Abdaal, who moderated. Abdaal asked flattering questions about MacAskill’s generosity, and it was a while before it was made clear that everyone on stage was sympathetic towards effective altruism. FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried were not mentioned or raised in questions from the audience. I sat close to a young woman who laughed heartily at MacAskill’s jokes and approached me afterwards to ask, with evangelical keenness, why I was taking notes. She worked for an EA organisation, too, and when I told her I was a journalist her smile turned rictus. No one has suggested that senior EAs knew of Bankman-Fried’s fraud, but my conversations corroborated investigations by Time and the New Yorker suggesting that MacAskill and others had been repeatedly warned about Bankman-Fried’s business practices. Some of these warnings date back to 2018, when half the staff of Alameda Research – a crypto-trading firm co-founded by Bankman-Fried and staffed almost entirely with EAs – quit, accusing Bankman-Fried of being “negligent”, “unethical” and “misreporting numbers”. There was a marked lack of curiosity, one former senior EA told me. “When a bunch of people who are trusted in the community leave and say that [Bankman-Fried is untrustworthy], if you didn’t investigate that thoroughly you’re being extremely foolish. And if you did, I think you would have known that there were reasons to at least be very concerned about the possible blowback of making him the poster boy of the movement.” The former EA observed that earlier in 2022 another crypto billionaire affiliated with the movement, the British entrepreneur Ben Delo, pleaded guilty before a US court for failing to implement sufficient anti-money-laundering checks – an incident that ought to have prompted EA’s leadership to consider the risks of associating with the super-rich. The leadership’s judgement had been clouded by greed, said the former EA: “but a weird kind of greed. It’s greed to have more power and money behind your ideology – it’s philosopher’s greed.” In the aftermath of FTX’s collapse, some EAs wondered why people within the community had shared stories extolling Bankman-Fried’s frugality – in media profiles, he was the billionaire who slept on a beanbag, lived in a house share and drove a Corolla – when so many had visited his $40m penthouse in the Bahamas. Some former EAs suggested to me that perhaps the disconnect between the legend and the reality was overlooked because Bankman-Fried spoke the right language: he was an admirably “hardcore utilitarian”. In June this year, MacAskill seemed to concede that he had been naive. Writing on the EA forum, he said: “Looking forward, I’m going to be less likely to infer that, just because someone has sincere-seeming signals of being highly morally motivated, like being vegan or demonstrating credible plans to give away most of their wealth, they will have moral integrity in other ways, too.” The extent of Bankman-Fried’s sincerity is unclear: was he reckless because he believed the ends justified the means, or did he use EA to burnish his reputation? In a Vox interview conducted via Twitter DMs shortly after FTX collapsed, he suggested the latter: the “ethics stuff” was “a dumb game we woke Westerners play where we say all the right shiboleths [sic] and so everyone likes us”. The former EAs I spoke to expressed anger at the movement’s leadership for falling silent in the aftermath. “Everybody’s fleeing the community and it makes me quite angry,” said one, “because these people were all happy to take talent, take status, while the times were good. And as soon as the times were bad, when they needed to step up, they decided to get on the first boat.” They cited MacAskill saying he shouldn’t be “the face of EA” and Holden Karnofsky, a co-CEO of Open Philanthropy, writing on forums that EA “isn’t a great brand for wide public outreach”. Another ex-EA told me the movement needed to do more to care for its members. “There’s a tendency to encourage young, naive people to put themselves in risky situations, to make a lot of personal and financial sacrifices, and then to provide no support or safety net. Because suddenly you can be on the out – you can be labelled as a person who is not that smart, who doesn’t have good judgement, or who doesn’t have integrity.” For many, EA is their identity and their social and professional network, they said. “It means that if it goes wrong, your entire life falls apart.” Many people described struggling emotionally after leaving, because it was hard to shake the mindset, to still derive meaning and self-worth when you are no longer “maximising good”. Now that Bankman-Fried’s trial is over, or when the Charity Commission’s investigation closes, perhaps William MacAskill will finally say more. It will be tempting for effective altruism’s defenders to continue to portray Sam Bankman-Fried as a rogue actor. But it would be more honest to acknowledge the role the movement played in the crisis, and the risks that come from allowing a few billionaires to determine how to do the “most good”. For their community to survive in a recognisable form, those involved in EA will have to grapple with its politics, and find some way to reconcile its anti-poverty idealism and its tendency towards Silicon Valley millenarianism. No graph or calculation will help them do that. For now, the steady, determined work of the effective altruists continues – but not without frustration. “I am tired of having a few people put on pedestals because they are very smart – or very good at self-promotion,” one member wrote on the EA forum this year. “I am tired of being in a position where I have to apologise for sexism, racism and other toxic ideologies within this movement… I am tired of billionaires. And I am really, really tired of seeing people publicly defend bad behaviour as good epistemics.” A vegan social worker, she had committed to giving away over 10 per cent of her income.

beyond climate jargon reflections climate conference season 2023,Cisco.com,https://blogs.cisco.com/our-corporate-purpose/beyond-the-climate-jargon-reflections-from-climate-conference-season-2023,jocelyn matyas manages cisco foundation climate impact regeneration investing portfolio shares lessons climate conference season,professionals many sectors fall season marathon conferences panels webinars events climate sector exception climate week nyc kicked 7682 chars,2023-11-17T15:32:31Z," Jocelyn Matyas  For professionals of many sectors, fall is the season for a marathon of conferences, panels, webinars and events. For the climate sector, this is no exception and Climate Week NYC kicked it off with a bigger-than-ever crowd, next it was VERGE in San Jose, culminating to COP28. The development of many conversations and discussions in this space, more than usual, left me feeling hopeful. Hopeful because it felt that an overwhelming number of climate conversations explored specific topics deeply, were centered on action today, and strove to rise above, or even slice through, the depths of jargon that often make it difficult to get to the “so what really are we going to do about it?” part of important conversations. These critical sentiments, conversations and questions explored included the following. For a while now, climate action is often used simultaneously with carbon reduction. To reduce carbon, we look to engineering new, more sustainable, efficient technologies. However, in a comprehensive carbon strategy, there are solutions to reduce carbon emissions, remove carbon from the atmosphere, and protect or preserve natural carbon sinks. In recent years and conferences, airtime and large-scale efforts by large stakeholders were often paying most attention to the reduction of emissions as well as engineered carbon removal. It was prevalent in this year’s events that a multitude of actors and capital providers showed up energized, informed, and ready to ensure nature-based solutions alongside the preservation and restoration of nature not only were present in strategic discussions, but center stage in them. Thankfully, the intersectionality of inclusion and clean energy is a shared interest across the climate space. However, as commonly occurs, this intersection was given a jargony title that we began seeing painted across projects, strategies, and conversations at length. As the title became common and shared, I could not help but question if we – both the diverse climate community as well as the public – really do have a shared, comprehensive definition of what this phrase means and if this meaning is still capturing the voices of underserved communities themselves. Reflecting on such, I took the opportunity to ask a local Indigenous leader from Arizona and an inner-city community leader from New York City what this phrase meant to them and was both enlightened and refreshed by their different takes on the same topic. Additionally, Nantu Canelos, Director of Territorial Autonomy of Cisco Foundation grantee, Kara Solar, also shared their thoughts on the topic, “In the remote communities of the Amazon rainforest such as Achuar territory, where I live, we are transitioning our energy use from gasoline to solar, and from not having energy to having energy. We use solar energy for transportation, for communication, for light, and other purposes. We see energy as a way to improve the lives of our people, and to alleviate pressures on the ecosystems we live in and depend on, which further improves the lives of us humans, creating a beneficial cycle. When we work with technologies, we focus on building local understanding. Local technicians are trained, and solar energy is embedded in the school curriculum so that children learn about it from a young age. In that way we can make sure that the benefits are sustainable, and that this energy transition is truly just.” In a typical pass by interaction, another climate enthusiast shared gratitude for posing this question publicly and expressed that she too found herself reflecting on the intentionality and reality behind and beyond our most used climate jargon. It was clear people were questioning, redefining or even looking past the jargon all around, especially those capturing themes of justice and inclusion. Conversations around climate finance only continue to mature and acknowledge the unique capital stack necessary to reverse the impacts of climate change. Discussions of this week did not harp on “what” we need and “why”, but rather dissected and challenged capital providers of all sorts to think about “how”. For example, for corporate climate financiers, Salesforce at Climate Week NYC published The Corporate Climate Finance Playbook. Additionally, the  Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance (the Lab) endorsed six innovative financial instruments to accelerate climate action in emerging markets, including Cisco Foundation investee, The Catalyst Fund. Maelis Carraro, Managing Partner of Catalyst Fund, shares more about their approach to materializing this call to action, “Catalyst Fund was intentionally designed as a blended finance structure so that a concessionary capital layer could provide downside risk protection for senior investors and catalyze more private investment to climate adaptation and resilience in Africa.  This type of structure can be incredibly powerful in leveraging multiple types of capital (concessionary and commercial) to invest in nascent sectors, underserved and frontier markets, and unlocking benefits to underserved communities. Climate resilience and climate tech more broadly in Africa remain a nascent asset class and we were proud to be endorsed by the CPI Lab as one of this year’s most innovative instruments for climate adaptation!” The 2020 International Energy Agency’s Clean Energy Innovation perspectives report expresses: “Almost 35% of the [reductions needed to avoid a 2 degree C temperature rise must] come from technologies that are currently at the prototype or demonstration phase which will not become available at scale without further R&D. About 40% of the cumulative emissions reductions rely on technologies that have not yet been commercially deployed in mass market applications.” This will require new hardware innovation. A sector which has significant capital requirements, long time frames, and a high level of technological risk. To develop these hardware breakthroughs will require capital providers coming together to provide a diverse capital stack as well as potentially a new investment model. Azolla Ventures is an innovative investment fund trying to tackle just that. Matthew Nordan, General Partner at Azolla Ventures shares, “To avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, we have to pair both emissions reduction and carbon removal at mass scale. We’re not going to forestall climate catastrophe solely with the technologies that exist and are ready now such as solar, wind, short-duration energy storage, and electric vehicles. We need new innovations that are neither developed nor deployed today. There is some irony that the innovations that are most potentially impactful are often the ones least likely to be financed at the earliest stages because the risk is so high and the time frame is so long; our approach is purpose-built to fill this gap.” During this conference season, we not only heard these points from Azolla Ventures, but in climate tech roundtables as well as presentations from other investors like Third Sphere. As we continue to provide financing for solutions via the Cisco Foundation Climate Commitment, these discussions and progress in how we think about the solutions we need and how to finance them are vital to the success we will have in playing our part in driving climate action. We are eager, energized, and enthused to continue to co-learn, support, and collectively act alongside an array of innovators, capital providers, ecosystem builders, and visionaries to build a more sustainable and regenerative future.","a number of climate conversations explored specific topics deeply, were centered on action today, and strove to rise above, or even slice through, the depths of jargon that often make it difficult to get to the “so what really are we going to do about it?” part of important conversations. the intersectionality of inclusion and clean energy is a shared interest across the climate space.",positive,Technology,Technology,Politics,3

According to the UN-backed organization, the total volume of diamond production in the world last year amounted to 119.96 million carats. Of these, 41.9 million were sourced in Russia, or 35%. Since 2004, when the agency started tracking output volumes, Russian rough diamond production has never accounted for more than 32% of the total. Another 61.6 million carats were mined in African countries, with the continent's largest diamond supplier, Botswana, producing 24.5 million carats. Calculations show that together, Russia and Africa accounted for more than 90% of global output last year. The globe's third-largest rough diamond producer was Canada, with 16.3 million carats. The two largest exporters of rough diamonds, meanwhile, were the United Arab Emirates with 89.4 million carats or 27% of global exports, and the EU with 75.2 million carats or 22.7%. These are considered the globe’s most prominent diamond trading hubs. Russia’s share among global rough diamond exporters was 11.1% (36.7 million carats). Amid Ukraine-related sanctions last year, imports of Russian rough diamonds were either banned or partially restricted by the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand. The EU and the Group of Seven (G7) countries have also been considering a more detailed ban on Russian diamonds over the past several months, which would prevent both direct and indirect imports. According to media reports citing EU officials, they plan to introduce a tracking system that would include physical checks of packages with gems and compulsory traceability data for diamond producers and traders. It is currently unclear when the mechanism is expected to be introduced. Industry experts have warned that such a ban could jeopardize the global diamond market. Russia, meanwhile, has been actively redirecting its diamond trade to the markets of China, India, the UAE, Armenia, and Belarus, which have all seen a surge in gem imports from the sanctioned country over the past year.

brics overtaking g7 economic might bloomberg,RT,https://www.rt.com/business/586901-brics-economic-might-growth-g7/,expanded brics group g7 swapped places relative size 2040 bloomberg analysis shows read full article rt com,rapid rise brics transforming global economy group share world gdp terms purchasing power parity ppp set rise well beyond group seven g7 1992 chars,2023-11-12T14:16:24Z,"The rapid rise of the BRICS is transforming the global economy, with the group’s share of world GDP in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) set to rise well beyond of that of the Group of Seven (G7) major advanced economies, Bloomberg reported this week. BRICS currently comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, but the group will be joined in January by Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The G7 club of industrialized and developed countries consists of the US, Canada, the UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan. The report indicated that the expanded BRICS are already larger than the G7. In 2022 the bloc accounted for 36% of the global economy, versus 30% for the advanced economy group. “Our forecasts suggest an expanding workforce and ample room for technological catch-up will boost the BRICS+ share to 45% by 2040, compared with 21% for G7 economies. In effect, BRICS+ and the G7 will have swapped places in relative size between 2001 and 2040,” Bloomberg wrote. The outlet also pointed out that the expanded BRICS economic group will contain some of the world’s largest oil exporters, namely Saudi Arabia, Russia, UAE and Iran, as well as some of its biggest importers – China and India. “If it [BRICS] succeeds in shifting some settlement of oil transactions toward other currencies, that could have a knock-on effect on the share of the dollar in international trade and global foreign exchange reserves,” the report added, noting that the BRICS members have been working actively to abandon the greenback in their trade. While highlighting the advantages of BRICS, such as its size, diversity and ambition, the report also pointed out some of the challenges facing the group, including China’s economic slowdown, the inability to shift away from the petrodollar in the near future, as well as a ‘reluctance’ to promote a single alternative. “The BRICS will change the world, but perhaps more because of their rising share of GDP and divergent political and economic systems than through the realization of policymakers’ grand plans,” Bloomberg concluded.
